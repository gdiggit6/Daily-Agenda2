#		The Major Arcana

'The Fool\n\nDionysos, the Fool, augurs the advent of a new chapter of life when he appears in a spread. A risk of some kind is required, a willingness to jump out into the unknown. The Fool is ambiguous just as Dionysus is, for we cannot know whether we will enter the Fool\'s perception of the divine or end up merely looking foolish. In this way, amidst ambiguity and excitement and fear, begins the great journey of life portrayed by the Major Arcana of the Tarot.', 

'The Magician\n\nHermes, the Magician, points to potential skills and creative abilities which have not yet manifested. He may appear as an upsurge of energy and an intuition of exciting new opportunities. He presages insight and an awareness of unexplored possibilities. The Fool is blind, with only his animal sense of a meaning to be found somewhere, somehow. But through his meeting with Hermes, the Magician, it becomes clear that the journey is possible, and that one has capacities that have yet to be developed.',

'The Empress\n\nThe appearance of the Empress in a spread suggests the onset of a more earthy phase of life. A marriage or the birth of a child might occur; or the birth of a creative child, an artistic offspring, for this too requires the patience and nurturing of the Great Mother. Through this card we enter the realm of the body and the instincts, as a place of both peace and stagnation, life-giving and lie-suffocating. Thus the Fool, the child of heaven, discovers that he lives in a physical body and is a creature not only of spirit but also of earth.',

'The Emperor\n\nZeus, the Emperor, augurs a confrontation with the issue of the father principle in both its positive and negative forms. We are challenged to make something manifest, to concretize a creative idea, to build something in the world, to found a business perhaps, or to establish the structure of a home and family. We are asked to take a standpoint, to become effective and powerful, to formulate our ideas and ethics. We are also asked to consider where the creative young king has become the rigid, oppressive tyrant, and where our ideologies are interfering with life and growth. When the Fool meets the Emperor after his sojourn in the instinctual world, he learns to confront worldly life with his own resources, alone, according to ethics which he must develop for himself. Then he can progress on his journey with the certainty that he can be effective in life because there is something higher in which he believes, and whose authority he himself now embodies.',

'The High Priestess\n\nThe appearance of the High Priestess in a spread augurs the heightening of the powers of intuition, and implies that there will be an encounter of some kind with the hidden inner world which Persephone rules. The individual may be drawn inexplicably to this world through an interest in the occult or the esoteric, or through the effects of a powerful dream or the uncanny sense that \'something\' is at work in one\'s life. Thus the Fool, having learned something of his physical nature and needs and his place in the world through his earthly parents, the Empress and the Emperor, now enters the night-world, and comes, often with confusion and bewilderment, to that silent figure who embodies Mother on another, deeper and subtler level-the womb of the unconscious in which the secret of his real purpose and the pattern of his destiny are contained.',

'The Hierophant\n\nChiron, the Hierophant, implies when he appears in a spread that the individual will begin to actively seek answers of a philosophical kind. This may emerge as the study of a particular philosophy or system of belief, or as a deep commitment to a quest for meaning in life. The Hierophant may appear in the form of an analyst, psychotherapist, priest or spiritual mentor in outside life to whom we turn for comfort and help. The Fool thus emerges from his discovery of the underworld and the hidden powers of the unconscious seeking answers to the enigma of himself and the meaning of his life. When he meets the Hierophant he encounters that part of himself which can begin to formulate, and express a personal philosophy, an individual vision of the spirit, which guides him as he leaves his childhood behind and ventures out into life\'s challenges.',

'The Lovers\n\nThe card of the Lovers when it appears in a spread augurs the necessity of a choice of some kind, usually in love. The Fool, having learned about his own duality, must now put his values to the test. Sometimes this means a love triangle, but it can also mean the problem of too hasty a marriage, or a choice between love and a career or some creative activity. This card implies the necessity of looking carefully at the implications of one\'s choices, rather than being driven blindly, thereby inaugurating, like Paris, a great conflagration.',

'The Chariot\n\nThe card of the Chariot appearing in a spread augurs conflict and struggle which can result in a stronger personality. One may come face to face not only with aggression in others, but with one\'s own competitive and aggressive drives. This conflict cannot be avoided, but needs to be faced with strength and containment. Thus the Fool comes to harmony through learning to handle his own contradictions, and passes from the world of adolescence to the next stage of his journey.',

'Justice\n\nThe card of Justice appearing in a spread implies the need for balanced thought and impartial decision-making. But hike Athene\'s sword, this card can be double-edged. There are spheres of life where Athene\'s cool reflection is too chilly, too idealistic, and too destructive to the warmth of personal relationship. Her sword can cut the heart with general truths which are inappropriate for a particular situation. Thus Justice is, like all the Major Arcana, an ambivalent figure. The Fool must develop what Athene represents, but he cannot stay forever in her pure temple, and must pass on to the next Moral Lesson.',

'Temperance\n\nThe appearance of Temperance in a spread implies the need for a flow of feeling in relationship. Iris, guardian of the rainbow, suggests the potential for harmony and cooperation resulting in a good relationship or a happy marriage. We are challenged with the issue of learning to develop a balanced heart, while also being gently reminded that the Fool cannot remain forever even with the beautiful Iris, and must pass on to the next Moral Lesson.',

'Strength\n\nThe card of Strength, when it appears in a spread, implies a situation where a collision with the lion within is inevitable, and where a creative handling of one\'s own rage and senseless pride is desirable. Courage, strength and self-discipline are necessary to battle with the situation. Through such an experience we can come in contact with the beast, but also with that part of us which is Heracles, the hero who can subdue it. Thus the Fool, having developed the faculties of mind and feeling, now learns to deal with his own ferocious egotism, emerging from this contest with trust in himself and integrity toward others.',

'The Hermit\n\nThe card of Cronos, the Hermit, augurs a time of aloneness or withdrawal from the extroverted activities of life, so that the wisdom of patience may be acquired. There is an opportunity to build solid foundations if one is willing to wait. Thus the Fool at last arrives at maturity, having developed a mind and a heart, a firm sense of identity and finally a deep respect for his own limitations in the great passage of the round of time.',

'The Wheel of Fortune\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune augurs a sudden change of fortune. This may be \'good\'or \'bad\', but whichever way the Wheel turns it brings growth and a new phase of life. We cannot predict what will come to meet us-or rather, what we will turn to meet. But behind these changes stand the Moirai, an image of the center within. Thus the Fool is thrown from his complacency, and begins the descent to his own source.',

'The Hanged Man\n\nPrometheus, the Hanged Man, augurs the need for a voluntary sacrifice for the purpose of acquiring something of greater value. This might be the sacrifice of an external thing which has previously provided security, in the hope that some potential can be given room to develop. Or it can be the sacrifice of a cherished attitude, such as intellectual superiority, or unforgiving hatred, or a stubborn pursuit of some unobtainable fantasy. Thus the Fool responds to the challenge of the turning of the Wheel with a willingness to put his trust in the unseen workings of the unconscious, and waits-often with fear and anxiety-in the hope of a new and better life.',

'Death\n\nThe card of Death implies that something must come to an end. Whether or not this experience is painful depends upon the person\'s capacity to accept and recognize the necessity of endings. The card of Death can augur an opportunity for a new life, if one can let go of the old one. Thus the Fool enters the underworld, leaving behind him his previous life, to prepare for an unknown future.',

'The Devil\n\nHere we meet the great god Pan,whom the Greeks worshipped as the Great All. In myth, Hermes fathered Pan on the nymph Dryope. The child was so ugly at birth —with horns, beard, tail and goat-legs — that his mother ran away from him in fright, and Hermes carried him up to Olympus for the gods\' amusement. Pan haunted the woods and pastures of Arcadia, and personified the fertile, phallic spirit of wild, untamed nature. But he could also occasionally be friendly to men, guarding flocks, herds, and beehives. He took part in the revels of the mountain-nymphs and helped hunters to find their quarry. On one occasion he pursued the chaste nymph Syrinx to the River Ladon, where she transformed herself into a water-reed to escape his unwelcome hairy embraces. There, since he could not distinguish her from all the rest, he cut several reeds at random, and made them into a syrinx or Pan-pipe.\n\nFrom Pan\'s name we derive the word \'panic\', because he amused himself by giving the lonely traveler sudden frights. He was despised by the other gods, but they exploited his powers. Apollo the sun-god wheedled the art of prophecy from him, and Hermes copied a pipe which he had let fall, claimed it as his own invention, and sold it to Apollo. Thus the brilliant sun-god received both his music and his prophecy illicitly from the goatish, ugly and untamed god of nature.\n\nOn an inner level, Pan, the Devil, is an image of bondage to the crudest, most instinctual aspect of human nature. Because the god was worshipped in caves and grottoes, attended by fear, his image within us suggests something that we both fear and are fascinated by - the raw, goaush, uncivilized sexual impulses which we experience as evil because of their compulsive nature. Since the dawn of the Christian era,Devil, noble and romantic about the raging lion in the card of Strength, or the willful horses of the Chariot. But it is more difficult to perceive nobility in Pan. Yet in myth he was not evil, merely untamed, amoral and natural. It is the paralysis of the humans who are held enthralled interior and fascination which creates the problem. The card of the Devil implies blocks and inhibitions, usually sexual, which arise from our lack of understanding of Pan. Although he is ugly, he is the Great All — the raw life of the body itself, amoral and crude, but nonetheless a god. The energy which is expended in keeping the Devil in his cave, shameful and hidden, is energy which is lost to the personality, but which can be released with immensely powerful effect if one is willing to look Pan in the face. Thus the Fool must learn to confront with humility the basest and most shameful aspects of himself, or he will remain forever in bondage to his own fear. Then, in order to hide this shameful secret, he must pretend that he is superior and projects his own bestiality on others, leading to prejudice, bigotry and even persecution of individualsand races who seem to him \'evil\'.The card of Pan, the Devil, implies the necessity of a confrontation with all that is shadowy, shameful and base in the personality. The Fool must free himself by gaining knowledge and honest, humble acceptance of Pan, for then he can release the creative power which is held in chains by his own panic and self-disgust. Thus he comes to the heart of the labyrinth and faces his own darkness in the essential darkness of his body, in order to become what he always was-merely natural.',

'The Tower\n\nThe card of the Tower appearing in a spread augurs the breaking down of existing forms. This card, like the cards of Death and the Devil, depends a great deal upon the attitude of the individual in terms of how difficult or painful it is to deal with. Obviously it is more creative to ask oneself where one is constricted or bound by a false persona or image, because a willing effort to break through this pretense can spare a great deal of anguish. But it seems that the Tower will fall anyway, whether we are willing or unwilling, not because some malicious external fate decrees it, but because something within the individual has reached boiling point and can no longer live within such confines.',

'The Star\n\nThe card of the Star when it appears in a spread portends the experience of hope, meaning and faith in the midst of difficulties. Although the Star too can be ambivalent, and can warn against blind hope without the necessary action to build upon it, the card of the Star is an augury of promise, an altogether welcome experience for the Fool who has passed through the collapse of everything which he believed to be of value in his life.',

'The Moon\n\nOn an inner level, Hecate, the moon-goddess, is an image of the mysterious watery depths of the unconscious. We have already encountered this strange and elusive realm in two other cards in the Major Arcana: the High Priestess and the Wheel of Fortune. These three cards are linked in meaning and represent a progression in deepening understanding and experience of the world of the unconscious. Through Persephone, the High Priestess, the Fool becomes aware of an intuition of his own personal depths, a secret self which lay beneath ordinary mundane life. Through the Moirai who preside over the Wheel of Fortune, he experienced the power which we call Fate, through sudden changes of fortune that reveal an invisible law or purposeful pattern within. Here, in the card of the Moon, we find in the image of Hecate an experience of the great collective sea of the unconscious from which not only the individual but the whole of life has emerged. Hecate is more than a portrayal of personal depths. She embodies the feminine principle in life itself, and the three faces and three lunar phases reflect her multifaceted power over heaven, earth and underworld. In psychological terms, it is from this oceanic realm of the human imagination that the great myths and religious symbols and works of art are born over the centuries. It is a chaotic, confusing, unbounded world of which the individual with his personal journey and search for self are only a tiny part\n\n. The meeting with Hecate, the moon-goddess, is a confrontation with a trans-personal world, where individual boundaries dissolve and the sense of direction and ego are lost. It is as though we must wait submerged in the waters of this world while the new potentials arise which will eventually become our future. But the dark waters of the collective unconscious contain both negative and positive, and it is sometimes hard to distinguish its shifting movements from madness and delusion. It can be a frightening, anxiety-provoking world, for living in the realm over which Hecate presides means living without knowledge and clarity. Something has washed over us which cleanses the past and prepares the way for the future, but we must wait as the foetus waits in the womb. The only road to Hecate\'s world is the \'royal road\' of dreams, which like the crab tantalizes us with a glimpse and then slips back into the water again. The card of the Moon is a card of gestation, full of confusion, anxiety and bewilderment. We have nothing but the dream-world and the Star of Hope to guide us, for this image of the feminine is not a personal one like that of the High Priestess. It is vague and elusive and impersonal, embodying itself as shifting moods and confusion. Hecate is never really graspable, for she is a goddess of magic, and initiates the Fool into a world greater than himself, that primal water out of which all life comes.\n\nOn a divinatory level, the card of Hecate, the moon-goddess, augurs a period of confusion, fluctuation and uncertainty. We are in the grip of the unconscious and can do nothing but wait and cling to the elusive images of dreams and the vague sense of hope and faith. Thus the Fool awaits his rebirth in the waters of a greater womb, dimly aware that his journey of personal development is only a small fragment of a vast, unknowable life which spans millennia and which remains eternally fertile yet eternally unformed.',

'The Sun\n\nOn an inner level, Apollo, the sun-god, is an image of the power of consciousness to dispel the darkness. Like Hecate, who under the name of Artemis was Apollo\'s twin sister in myth, the god personifies something greater than one individual\'s capacity to gain knowledge and insight. Apollo is an image of the urge toward consciousness which exists in all life, and therefore he is the natural complement and antithesis to Hecate. Through many long centuries and through the rise and fall of many cultures and civilizations, the thrust toward knowledge and the craving for freedom from the bondage of dark, unknown nature has driven humankind toward impressive although dangerous heights. Apollo represents the spirit of intellectual striving, combined with a vision of the future which encompasses an ideal of perfection.\n\tThus the Fool\'s encounter with Apollo the sun-god brings him the hope and clarity of daylight after the long night of waiting in the womb of Hecate. Through many trials and losses the Fool has maintained his goal and his integrity; but the card of the Moon is a dark place where, although the end of the journey is near, the Fool has lost both his confidence and his power of action. But Apollo is the dispeller of fear, and his bright light casts away shadows. The shadows of the Moon are like the night-fears of childhood, where we feel small and unimportant in the face of the vastness of the unknown, threatened by gigantic shapes that loom in the darkness. Apollo is an image of that hope and faith which spring not from any one person\'s striving, but from all of us, a human inheritance of nobility and determination which can restore the Fool\'s faith in himself because it is also a faith in the meaningfulness and purpose of the human journey. The card of the Sun symbolizes that indomitable spirit that has always struggled against superstition, helplessness, ignorance and bondage to fatalism and despair.\n\t It is this spirit which battles with the serpent Python, the embodiment of the negative power of blind instinct and primitive fear. Apollo\'s music also lifts us out of ourselves, for music speaks with a trans-personal voice, crossing cultures and centuries and embodying human tragedy and triumph. Thus Apollo is a great deity, respected by all the gods, and even the Moirai were once made subject to his will — although only once. But the sun-god too is ambivalent, for too much light too soon can kill if knowledge is premature and destroys the necessary time and darkness for things to gestate. Therefore the card of the Sun follows after the card of the Moon. The burning heat of the sun can scorch, for it does not respect nature\'s laws. Thus Apollo in myth was often rejected in his advances toward women, for his light was sometimes too bright.\n\n The card of Apollo, the sun-god, augurs a time of clarity, optimism and renewed trust. It is possible to understand the pattern, to plan for the future, to move forward. The curses of the night are dispelled, and the Fool is now armed with foresight, purpose and a faith in the striving human spirit. Thus he encounters that great masculine principle in life, working through both men and women, which moves forward toward the goal.',

'Judgment\n\nThe card of Judgment, when it appears in a spread, augurs a time when the rewards of past efforts appear. This is a period of summing-up, of a realization of what we have been doing and where we ourselves have created the future which now awaits us. It is an ambiguous card, for it can also imply a disturbing confrontation with all our own evasions and self-betrayals. The reward is not always a pleasant one. The Fool must now answer for his journey, for the time of harvest has arrived, and the mistakes and creative efforts of the past are gathered together to form the future. Whatever occurs to the individual in terms of experiences, the card of judgment heralds the end of a chapter in life. But unlike the card of Death, it does not imply mourning. Rather, it is a clear perception of the extent to which we have been able to be true to ourselves.',

'The World\n\nThe card of the World when it appears in a spread augurs a time of achievement and integration. This is a period of triumph at the successful conclusion of a matter, or the reaching of a goal which has been worked hard for. But this peak is merely a glimpse of something mysterious and elusive, and the dancing Hermaphroditus becomes the fetus who eventually emerges from the cave as the Fool. Thus the great cycle of the Major Arcana ends where it begins, for we might start with Hermaphroditus as the unborn potential of the personality which ultimately leads to the birth of the Fool. And so the circle, like the World Snake, is complete.',

#			The Minor Arcana

#			The Suit of Cups
#	The Numbered Cards

'Ace of Cups\n\nThe Ace of Cups heralds an outpouring of feeling, although this feeling has not yet differentiated and emerges as raw, vital and often overwhelming. The potential is implied for the beginning of a relationship, although often this has not yet manifested. The individual is ready to embark on the journey of love.',

'Two of Cups\n\nThe Two of Cups augurs the beginning of a relationship. It can also suggest a reconciliation where an already existing relationship has undergone difficulty or separation. It can even imply the meeting and contractual arrangements of business partners, for here too the element of relationship is invoked.',

'Three of Cups\n\nThe Three of Cups suggests the celebration of a marriage, the start of a love affair, the birth of a child, or some other situation of emotional fulfillment and promise. But each of these situations is also a beginning, an initiation into deeper levels of the heart\'s experience, and the herald of further explorations in the future.',

'Four of Cups\n\nThe Four of Cups augurs a time of dissatisfaction, boredom and depression within a relationship. There is a feeling of being let down or cheated, although the one who does the cheating is usually oneself because of one\'s unreal expectations. This dissatisfaction can lead to long-standing, unexpressed resentment; or it can lead to looking more deeply at the relationship, a harder path because previous assumptions and fantasies will then be challenged.',

'Five of Cups\n\nThe Five of Cups implies regret over past actions. Something has gone wrong, a betrayal has occurred, and there is sadness and remorse. Separation in a relationship can occur. But this card does not augur a final ending. Something remains which can be worked on, and it is up to the individual to take up the challenge and make the commitment to the future.',

'Six of Cups\n\nThe Six of Cups augurs a time of serenity which grows out of the testing of the dreams of the past. Sometimes an old love from the past returns, or a cherished dream which one has held in the past seems possible of fruition in the near future. The blind \'in love\' state has solidified, and although the past may seem beautiful and irrevocably lost, something of its promise emerges, tempered and strengthened, into the present. This card implies nostalgia about the past, but with a difference: The past can lead to the future, and the dream is experienced as still possible, even near achievement.',

'Seven of Cups\n\nThe Seven of Cups augurs an emotional situation where many potentials are evident, but where the individual is faced with the challenge of choosing and acting in realistic terms to make those potentials manifest.',

'Eight of Cups\n\nThe Eight of Cups represents the most diffcult stage of Psyche\'s journey toward her goal of relationship: the voluntary giving up of hope for the future. No living mortal can descend into Hades\' realm, and as far as Psyche is concerned, this final task that Aphrodite has set must mean death. Nevertheless she obeys the goddess, for she is loyal to her commitment to love. Thus it is a letting go of hope. All the tasks so meticulously performed, suggested by the eight neatly stacked cups, have been to no avail. She sees the situation as it truly is — that Aphrodite will never relent — and so in despair she turns her back and walks away from her past hopes.\n\tThis stage of relationship is one of the most painful, because it means that there is nothing further that can be done. Increased efforts avail nothing; we must give up and start again. Many people, when confronted with the dilemma reflected by the Eight of Cups, refuse to acknowledge the impasse, and continue to plead, bully, bludgeon or blackmail the partner in the hope of a response which is no longer possible in the present circumstances. The underworld, as we saw in the Major Arcana card of Death, is a symbol of mourning and the relinquishing of control; it is the place of the death and transformation of our old attitudes. Therefore, when nothing furthers, we must be willing to let go, not as a kind of \'deal\' to guarantee a future reconciliation — for that is not true relinquishing — but because we can do nothing else. This is a bowing to what seems like fate, an acceptance of an ending. Whatever happens, this letting go will change us, because it is a submission to that which is greater — not the willfulness of the partner, but the will of the divine, imaged here as the great goddess of love.\n\nThe Eight of Cups implies the necessity of giving something up. The truth of the situation must be faced; no further action will avail, and there is no way to go except to let go. Often this is accompanied by depression, for the underworld is a place of mourning. The future cannot be manipulated; we go empty-handed into the unknown.',

'Nine of Cups\n\nThe Nine of Cups heralds a time of pleasure and satisfaction, and the fulfillment of a cherished wish. It represents the reward for efforts made, and the validation of one\'s commitment.',

'Ten of Cups\n\nThe Ten of Cups represents a stateof permanence and ongoing contentment. The ecstasy of the reunion of the lovers in the Nine of Cups has not dissipated, as did the celebration of the Three into the discontent of the Four, for this marriage is built upon a conscious union of two loving but separate partners. Thus they can enjoy a future which will withstand any challenges offered by life or by the gods.\n\nThat Psyche is raised to immortal status implies that her love for Eros now encompasses not only a personal, sensual dimension, but a spiritual one as well. Eros has been humanized by Psyche\'s love; he no longer needs to hide his face from her sight. Psyche, on the other hand, experiences that sense of connectedness with the divine which deep love can sometimes bring. It is sometimes said that loving another person opens the heart to loving life itself; life has meaning and purpose, and a larger, brighter world appears before one\'s vision. Plato once wrote that when we look into the face of the beloved, we see there the reflection of the god to whose choir we once belonged. It is as though love, when it has passed through many tests and been built upon honesty and humility, connects us with our own souls, and with a feeling of permanence, meaning and rightness in life. This is the promise inherent in the Ace of Cups, which culminates in the Ten. Not every relationship can achieve it, and no relationship can achieve it all the time. Yet we humans seem to go on trying.\n\nThe Ten of Cups augurs ongoing contentment and permanence in the realm of the heart.',

#=====================================================
#	The Court Cards

'Page of Cups\n\nWhen the Page of Cups appears in a spread, the birth of something new on the feeling level is suggested. This might be a new relationship, a new quality of feeling within a relationship, even the birth of a child. Often the Pape of Cups augurs a renewal of the capacity to love, beginning with love of self, after a time of hurt and withdrawal. This delicate quality must be nurtured or it can rapidly vanish.',

'Knight of Cups\n\nWhen the Knight of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to experience this heady and romantic dimension of love. Often the Knight augurs a proposal of marriage, or an experience of falling in love. Sometimes, on another level, he implies an artistic proposition, a relationship of another kind which is no less exalted and idealistic. Or he may enter one\'s life as a poetic and sensitive young man-a herald of one\'s own emerging romanticism.',

'Queen of Cups\n\nWhen the Queen of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to encounter the deep, unknowable, paradoxical world of feeling in himself or herself. The Queen of Cups may enter one\'s life as a mysterious, hypnotic woman, not necessarily overtly seductive yet strangely disturbing, and a catalyst for the emergence of deep feelings and fantasies which have previously been hidden from awareness. She may appear as a beloved or as a rival, but either way such an encounter is not mere chance. It is rather an augury for the emergence of these soul qualities within the individual. For the woman who is unaware of the Helen in herself and identifies with the maternal or practical sides of femininity, the Queen of Cups implies that it is time to meet her, even if the catalyst is the \'other woman\'. For the man who is unaware of the depths of his own soul, and bases his reality on rational thought and concrete facts, the Queen of Cups heralds a deepening and development of the inner life, whether or not the catalyst is an actual woman.',

'King of Cups\n\nWhen the King of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to experience this ambivalent side of himself or herself-the gifted counsellor and healer who can empathize with and help others, yet who cannot quite trust life enough to take its course. It is characteristic that many of those in the helping professions choose such a vocation because they have been wounded through personal relationships, often those with the parents; and thus they form relationships where they remain ultimately in control and cannot be that deeply hurt again. Although this kind of dynamic may contribute a great deal to others, one cheats oneself. If the King of Cups enters the individual\'s life in the form of a person who embodies these qualities, then this may be taken as an indication that it is time to meet this dimension of oneself.',

#=====================================================

#			The Suit of Wands
#	The numbered cards

'Ace of Wands\n\nThe Ace of Wands heralds an up rush of creative energy, although this energy has not yet formulated as a goal or project. Restlessness and dissatisfaction with present circumstances are accompanied by a strong feeling that new things are possible. The individual is about to embark on an adventure in pursuit of a vision.',

'Two of Wands\n\nThe Two of Wands, like the other Twos of the Minor Arcana, polarizes the raw energy of the Ace, and here that polarization implies the adventurer and his newly conceived goal. The restlessness and unformed power of the Ace has begun to coalesce as a particular vision, although just how that vision might be achieved is not at all clear. Jason does not yet know about the Golden Fleece; but he knows now, because Chiron has told him, that he is a prince and the rightful heir to the throne of Iolkos, and that his father Aeson has been deposed and imprisoned by his wicked uncle Pelias. The feeling of potential has here crystallized into something definite, although the real creative adventure of Jason\'s future — the pursuit of the Golden Fleece — will only emerge once Jason steps forth on the first stage of his journey. \n\nThus begin all creative ventures: a little at a time. One idea leads to another, and often the first one is not the final one, but merely a prelude. However, the prelude is sufficient to get us moving out of the sanctuary of the cave, because of the feeling that we could have more than we have, or be more than we are. Jason\'s journey to Iolkos, the place of his rightful inheritance, is fraught with danger, for he has an enemy there who would cheerfully take his life. He cannot predict the outcome, and if he will succeed or fail. But he believes in his vision enough to try, and firmly grips the wands which symbolize the fire of the imagination. Otherwise he — or we would remain peaceful but forever stifled in the cave, safe but never fulfilling those potentials which are a birthright but which require vision to bring into concrete being.\n\nThe Two of Wands heralds the formulation of a new aim, idea, goal or creative project. This new idea may not be the final shape of the future, but it is full of potential, and sufficient to lure the individual out of his or her present confines into a new creative venture. Everything here depends upon the courage of the individual to take the new idea up with both hands, and to put faith in that invisible creative power which has generated the vision of the new path.',

'Three of Wands\n\nThe Three of Wands implies a stage of initial completion of a creative idea or project. Good foundations have been laid, enthusiasm is high, and there is a feeling of satisfaction and optimism about the future potential of the project...But there is also hard work ahead, and new plans which must be put into action before the full promise can be realized.',

'Four of Wands\n\nThe Four of Wands is a card of harvest and reward. The challenge of a new creative idea has been met, hard work has been applied, and now the individual can reap the solid reward which has been earned through effort. Like the Three ofWands, this card implies something worth celebrating; but unlike the Three, it has a more solid base, and benefits are already evident. The challenge of capturing the Golden Fleece is a daunting one; how can one man alone sail to the ends of the earth, and in what? Jason has responded to this challenge by gathering around him those friends who can help him to achieve his aims. All these heroes in the myth have different skills, according to their natures. Heracles has strength; Theseus, a fiery adventurer like Jason, has creative vision; the Twins have the cutting edge of the clever mind, and Orpheus has the deep feeling and empathy to disarm any foe. Whether we take these friends as real people whoses support we can enlist, or as inner resources upon which we can draw, at this stage of the process of creative work the help is available by which the goal can be reached. With such a heroic crew gathered, and such a splendid ship built, for Jason satisfaction is in order.\n\nThe Four of Wands augurs a time of reward for efforts made. A creative idea has yielded early fruit, and the individual has every right to celebrate the concrete results of his or her efforts. But, this is only a stage on the journey, and soon the ship must set sail and face the hardest challenges before the final goal is reached.',

'Five of Wands\n\nThe Five of Wands augurs a time of struggle where the individual must battle with the dragon of material reality to achieve the goal. Mundane matters may begin to go wrong, and more attention must be paid to the demands and limits of concrete reality; or the individual falls into the grip of a depressive or apathetic mood. Compromises must be made while still retaining the integrity of the original vision.',

'Six of Wands\n\nThe Six of Wands augurs public acclaim or acknowledgement of some kind. This might take the form of a promotion, a qualification, or the recognition of some piece of creative work.',

'Seven of Wands\n\nThe Seven of Wands augurs a struggle with other people\'s creative ideas-stiff competition. The individual is challenged to improve upon and develop his or her project in the face of an envious and competitive world and needs to learn to value his or her ambition and competitive instinct.',

'Eight of Wands\n\nThe Eight of Wands heralds a period of action after delay or struggle. Travel is sometimes implied, or a clear stretch of fruitful creative activity, where the imagination flows unchecked after anxieties and tensions have been overcome or resolved.',

'Nine of Wands\n\nThe Nine of Wands heralds a time when, at the point of exhaustion, a final challenge arises to prevent us reaching our goal; and where, somehow, mysteriously, we can find the strength in reserve to meet the challenge. This strength is only available when we have used up every other possibility, and it seems to be invoked by both our need and our willingness, despite exhaustion, to try one more time.',

'Ten of Wands\n\nThe Ten of Wands implies that the individual is overburdened and oppressed by having taken on more than he or she can deal with. The imagination has been stifled by too many worldly concerns, and some of the youthful daring and willingness to take risks have been lost. Certain things may need to be relinquished so that the creative process can be refreshed and a new cycle may begin.',

#-----------------------------------------------------

#	The Court Cards

'Page of Wands\n\nWhen the Page of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to discover some new stirring of creative potential within himself or herself. This may often manifest as restlessness at work, a vague feeling of dissatisfaction not yet strong enough to motivate a change, and a hint or glimpse that one might be able to expand one\'s life in some way. The initial fantasies which accompany such restlessness do not have the up rushing power of the Ace of Wands, and may ultimately turn out to be impractical or impossible. Yet it is important to take them seriously, for they are the harbingers of a stronger source of inspiration, and need to be nurtured rather than stamped upon as though such restlessness were merely a \'bad phase\'rather than a herald.',

'Knight of Wands\n\nWhen the Knight of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to develop the volatile, exuberant and adventurous qualities embodied in the figure of Bellerophon. Often on a divinatory level the Knight of Wands manifests as a change of residence, because the individual suddenly feels too cramped by his or her environment and seeks broader and greener pastures. Sometimes the Knight of Wands will enter one\'s life in the form of a charming, exciting and rather unreliable young man, full of new ideas, who inspires but who must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt lest he lead one into a bad fall. But if such an individual enters one\'s sphere, it should be seen as an augury that these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.',

'Queen of Wands\n\nWhen the Queen of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to begin to develop these qualities of warmth, constancy, loyalty and creative sustaining of a vision which Penelope so aptly symbolizes. The Queen of Wands may enter one\'s life as such an imaginative and magnetic woman, full of warmth and life. But if such a person enters one\'s sphere it is not by chance, but rather an augury that the individual is about to meet these attributes within.',

'King of Wands\n\nWhen the King of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to encounter that dimension of the personality which initiates new ideas and sells them to others, thereby generating change in one\'s own life and in the immediate environment. It is the spirit of leadership, the belief that one has a better idea which is worth promulgating and working to make manifest. This dimension of life may appear in the form of a fiery, impulsive individual entering one\'s sphere, someone who infects others with the power of his ideas. But if such a person enters one\'s life it is not by chance, but is rather an augury of one\'s own need for development.',

#			The Suit of Swords
#	The Numbered Cards

'Ace of Swords\n\nThe Ace of Swords implies that out of conflict some new creative viewpoint will emerge. The mental powers are awakening and this means change in one\'s life; the old order is threatened, and conflicts are bound to arise. Ultimately a resolution will be possible but there is an inevitability of collision and struggle before such a peace is in sight.',

'Two of Swords\n\nThe Two of Swords implies a state of tense balance where there is a refusal to face some impending situation of conflict. A more creative way of handling this situation might be to try to face what is before one, rather than attempting to preserve the status quo, which will eventually be disrupted anyway.',

'Three of Swords\n\nThe Three of Swords is a sorrowful card, because the strife or conflict impended in the Two has at last erupted and come out into the open. Thus the theme of initial completion which links all the Threes in the Minor Arcana and is here reflected in a painful situation, where some separation or heartbreak has revealed itself. Yet while it is painful, this card, which is undoubtedly a diffcult one, represents a release of energy, for at least there is movement from the stagnant and unpleasant tension of the Two. Whatever has happened is in some way necessary, because something is at work which requires such conflict before it can unfold to its eventual creative end. Here Clytemnestra has had her revenge, and this revenge was inevitable from the moment that Agamemnon chose his own glory over the life of his daughter. Something set in motion in the past comes to fruition in the Three of Swords, and the fruit is rarely pleasant. This is the deepest meaning of the curse in Greek myth: not a spell or bad fate cast by some capricious god, but the inevitable working out of the consequences of human choice over time, which sooner or later will result in heartbreak or conflict when the bill comes due.\n\nThe sorrowful vision of the Three of Swords thus brings with it a feeling of relief, for the poison has come out, and therefore a chance of future healing becomes possible. Resentments which have remained subterranean because we are frightened of conflict and anger have a way of bursting through at last, but often through the next generation, who are forced to act out the problems which the preceding ones refused to face. Unpleasant though the Three of Swords is, it is nevertheless a creative step from the Two, and an ultimate resolution is now possible.\n\nThe Three of Swords heralds strife, conflict or separation. This painful state is in some way necessary, and there is a realization that blindness and self-delusion cannot go on. This is like the breaking of an abscess, so that the body can begin to heal.',

'Four of Swords\n\nThe Four of Swords heralds a time of quiet recuperation and introversion, where the individual can build up strength in preparation for further efforts. If this card appears in a spread, it is perhaps wise to accept solitude or withdrawal, and not seek to fill the time with activities; for some stillness is needed to marshal one\'s thoughts and order one\'s life.',

'Five of Swords\n\nThe Five of Swords augurs the necessity of facing one\'s own limits, and recognizing that life needs to be lived within the confines of one\'s capabilities. Often there is a situation where the individual has taken on too much, and must swallow pride and back off, facing honestly what is possible before moving forward.',

'Six of Swords\n\nThe Six of Swords suggests a time when the mind\'s capacity for understanding helps to ease a difficult and anxiety-provoking time into a more peaceful passage. Insight smooths the storm-clouds, and one can retain one\'s dignity and self-respect.',

'Seven of Swords\n\nThe Seven of Swords heralds a time when it is necessary to use guile, tact, diplomacy, and wit rather than strong armed bullying tactics to achieve one\'s ends. This may leave an uncomfortable feeling of falseness, but life may require it.',

'Eight of Swords\n\nThe Eight of Swords heralds a situation where the individual is unable to act because of his or her fear of the consequences. A decision is necessary, but either choice will lead to trouble. There is a dawning realization that one has created the dilemma oneself, for there is usually a long past of avoidance, duplicity, blindness and fear of confrontation, often to \'avoid hurting\' someone, which lies behind the present impasse. It is important to face honestly one\'s own part in the problem.',

'Nine of Swords\n\nThe Nine of Swords heralds a period of great anxiety and foreboding about the future. It is important to examine where guilt about the past might be behind such fears, rather than being enslaved by them to one\'s future detriment.',

'Ten of Swords\n\nThe Ten of Swords heralds the final ending of a difficult situation. The ending may be painful, but at last the situation is faced truthfully, and a new future, with fewer conflicts, can begin.',

#	The Court Cards

'Page of Swords\n\nWhen the Page of Swords appears in a spread, it is time to meet within oneself the childlike curiosity and potential for spiteful gossip which the Page embodies, and which marks the beginning of the use of mental powers. One may oneself be the victim of others\' gossip; or there can be a tendency to start petty quarrels and to be irritable and difficult. But these things reflect the emergence of new ideas and true independent thinking-often in one who has been accustomed to accepting the views of others.',

'Knight of Swords\n\nHere, in the card of the Knight of Swords, we meet the flexible, volatile and changeable dimension of the element of air, which is constantly in motion. This turbulence in the realm of the mind is embodied in the mythic quarrelsome Dioscuri, the Warrior Twins, who were called Castor and Polydeuces. Their mother was Leda, queen of Sparta, who was pursued by the amorous Zeus, king of the gods. When she refused the god\'s advances, he transformed himself into a swan and raped her. She was already pregnant by her husband King Tyndareos, and bore two eggs by her swan-lover. Out of one were hatched two mortal children, Castor and his sister Clytemnestra, whom we have already met in the story of Orestes in the numbered cards of the Suit of Swords. Out of the other egg came the two divine children of Zeus, Polydeuces and Helen whom we met in the Minor Arcana card of the Queen of Cups. Thus the Dioscuri were twin brothers, but Castor was mortal and Polydeuces divine.\n\nThe Dioscuri, who were never separated from one another in any adventure, became the pride of Sparta. Castor was famous as a soldier and tamer of horses, Polydeuces as a boxer. Both were pugnacious and known for their propensity to start quarrels. They eventually quarrelled with another pair of twins, called Idas and Lynceus. Idas killed Castor, the mortal twin, and Polydeuces in turn killed Lynceus with his spear. Zeus, intervening on behalf of his son, struck Idas dead with a thunderbolt. Polydeuces was grief-stricken at the loss of his brother, and prayed to his father Zeus that he might not outlive him. He refused immortality unless Castor might share it with him. Zeus therefore allowed them both to spend their days alternately in the divine abode of Olympus and beneath the earth in Hades\' realm; and he set their images among the stars as the Twins.\n\nThe Dioscuri are images of an abrupt and mercurial energy, the capacity of the human mind to be suddenly inspired or taken over by anew idea which throws the old order into chaos and leaves changes in its wake. The duality of the heavenly Twins suggests a duality or duplicity in this realm of the mind, because often these sudden new ideas which break in upon our humdrum lives either in augurate conflict or are themselves ambivalent and full of conflict. The pugnacity and callousness of the Dioscuri also tell us something about the quality of mental energy described by the Knight of Swords: It takes no account of human feeling, and is often the cause of relationships being disrupted or severed because the individual is suddenly possessed by an idea which demands his or her hurting another. Thus there is a basic attitude inherent in the Knight of Swords, which is not unlike the figure of Don Juan in romantic legend. This figure is intensely attractive because of his brilliance, but he is callous; he has no real feeling for the continuity of the past and the integrity of human relationship, and is not prepared to make personal sacrifices or compromise the cool and lofty vision of the moment.\n\nIn ordinary life we may see the energy of the Dioscuri at work when an individual abandons responsibilities and ties in order to pursue some new and youthful adventure. In psychology, this impulse is called the puer aeternus, the eternal youth, and it is an impulse which is more dominant in some people than in others. The spirit of the Knight of Swords cannot bear to grow old, or stagnate in too much bondage. Prolonged intimacy makes him fidget, and he needs constant mental stimuli in order to avoid becoming bored. He possesses the peculiar double face of being both destructive to feeling ties and of creatively catapulång an individual out of boredom and bondage into new phases of growth, which often necessitates a broken heart or two. Thus he serves both a negative and a positive function at the same time reflected here in the image of the Twins. To the Dioscuri, conflict and movement are natural, and one cannot spend too long feeling guilty about who might be hurt when the mind abruptly turns and moves in anew direction. The quicksilver quality of the Twins is reflected in the image by the agitation of the horse, which hardly touches the ground and which cannot remain still, bearing its twin riders onward toward new adventures.\n\nWhen the Knight of Swords appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to be prepared for sudden changes which break apart the ordinary patterns of life. These changes may be inaugurated by an individual coming into one\'s life who possesses the quicksilver, fascinating and disruptive qualities of the Dioscuri; or it may take the form of a new idea or vision which erupts from within oneself and which throws ordinary life into disorder for a time. Thus, whether the Knight of Swords appears from without or within, his gift is the ability to move with changes, and the turbulence which he brings may ultimately lead to a broader vision of life.',

'Queen of Swords\n\nWhen the Queen of Swords appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to meet that dimension of himself or herself which clings unswaying to an immovable faith in high ideals. These ideals may be noble and lofty, and help to improve consciousness and the quality of life. But they may also reject life, and be a defense against the fear of being human and therefore vulnerable to hurt. The individual needs to see where he or she might create problems through demanding superhuman perfection of others or oneself. If the Queen of Swords enters one\'s life as a strong, idealistic, aloof woman, it may be seen as a catalyst through which one discovers this aspect of oneself.',

'King of Swords\n\nWhen the King of Swords appears in a spread, it is time to meet within oneself the ambivalent gift of intellectual leadership and strategy. Intellectual prowess and inspired ideas about how to develop things in the future are qualities which he possesses in abundance. Sometimes this figure can appear in one\'s life in the form of an individual who is striking by virtue of his mental gifts and his capacity to innovate changes in the world. But if such an individual enters one\'s sphere it may be seen as a catalyst through whom one can contact this dimension of oneself.',

#			The Suit of Pentacles
#	The Numbered Cards

'Ace of Pentacles\n\nThe Ace of Pentacles augurs the possibility of material achievement, because the raw energy for this kind of work is now available to the individual. Often money is made available through a legacy or some other source, coupled with the ingenuity and persistence to utilize these resources effectively.',

'Two of Pentacles\n\nThe Two of Pentacles heralds a time when money and energy are likely to be available for new projects that might lead to a rewarding future; but the individual must be willing to put his resources to work, taking risks and using capital, rather than hoarding and saving at a time when new opportunities arise. Thus the Two of Pentacles is likely to be a welcome card to those who know how to \'play\' with money.',

'Three of Pentacles\n\nThe Three of Pentacles heralds a time of early success in some material endeavor. A project may earn profits, or a creative venture such as a book may show early success in the market. But as with all the Threes, this is not a final resolution, but a stage which will hopefully lead through hard work and difficulty to a more permanent reward.',

'Four of Pentacles\n\nThe Four of Pentacles warns about an attitude of holding too tightly to things which are bound up with one\'s sense of self-value. The fear of loss may mean no loss, but it also means no gain, for there is a stagnation of creative energy which can eventually not only block funds but also block self-expression.',

'Five of Pentacles\n\nThe Five of Pentacles augurs a period of financial difficulty or loss. This may be accompanied by a loss of faith in oneself, and it is important to try to respond to the challenge not only by letting go if necessary and preparing to begin again, but also by considering where one\'s own nature might have led to or exacerbated the problem. A reorientation is now possible not only on a financial level but also on an inner one.',

'Six of Pentacles\n\nThe Six of Pentacles augurs a situation where there is money or substance to be shared, and where the individual will himself or herself be called upon to offer generosity or be the recipient of another\'s generosity. Faith in life and in one\'s capacities is regained.',

'Seven of Pentacles\n\nThe Seven of Pentacles augurs a time when a difficult work decision must be made. Care and forethought are needed, and the question arises of whether to continue to develop what one has already built, or to put energy into a new project.',

'Eight of Pentacles\n\nThe Eight of Pentacles augurs a period when the individual plays the role of the hard-working apprentice who is struggling to acquire a new skill. This card can suggest a talent which the individual has recently discovered and which is worthy of development and effort, or it can imply that a hobby could be developed into a profession. The individual may experience great enthusiasm and interest in some new field of work which requires him or her to become a hard-working trainee, often at a time of life when one \'ought\' to be firmly established.',

'Nine of Pentacles\n\nThe Nine of Pentacles augurs a period where one may be justifiably pleased with oneself and with what one has been able to achieve. There is often a strong sense of solid identity, a feeling of one\'s unique abilities and the worth of one\'s life. This is not inflated, but based on a realistic appreciation of one\'s skills. This card reflects the solitary and self-sufficient enjoyment of good things, which does not depend upon anyone else\'s agreement or validation to provide pleasure and deep satisfaction.',

'Ten of Pentacles\n\nThe Ten of Pentacles suggests a period of ongoing contentment and security, and a sense of something permanent having been established which can be handed on to others. This may be a material inheritance of wealth or property, or it may be an artistic achievement such as a book or painting which one knows will live on and offer its value independent of one\'s own span of life.',

#-----------------------------------------------------

#	The Court Cards

'Page of Pentacles\n\nTriptolemus, the Page of Pentacles, is an image of those early and delicate efforts to relate to the sensual world which must emerge first before any larger ambitions of a material kind can be pursued. In common with all the Pages of the Minor Arcana, the Page of Pentacles is a bud, a bare beginning, and like all buds this gentle, delicate beginning of recognition of the value of the material world must be nurtured and protected lest it be crushed through undervaluing and neglect. Often the Page of Pentacles can suggest the early interest in some new hobby, which starts as a mere idea or enthusiasm, but which if cared for and developed slowly and patiently may eventually become a full-blown vocation which yields both material and emotional rewards and fulfilment. We have all experienced these little enthusiasms — but how many of us really follow them up, and try the necessary first small steps which might lead to something greater? Triptolemus, the Page of Pentacles, is a serious child, responsible and hard-working as few children are; at a young age he is given care of his father\'s cattle, instead of playing like other boys. Thus the energy of the Page of Pentacles needs to be treated gently but seriously. Likewise the image of Triptolemus may reflect the delicate beginnings of sensuality emerging, particularly if the individual has all his or her life undervalued this dimension of experience.\n\n The beginnings of sensual awareness in a more intellectual or imaginative temperament may be overlooked or despised, yet the myth of Triptolemus suggests that if the life of the body is recognized and valued as the boy recognizes and values the goddess Demeter, great rewards may emerge in the future. For many people this nascent awareness of the body may take the form of a desire to care for oneself better, through a better diet or exercise, or more time for relaxation, or an interest in gardening or caring for animals - playful things which lead to a deeper and stronger relationship with the earth itself.\n\nWhen the Page of Pentacles appears in a spread, it marks the gathering together of energy which can eventually be used for building things in the world and for fulfilling the needs of the body. Sometimes money becomes available in small sums, which need to be saved and nurtured rather than thrown away as insignificant. Sometimes the individual takes up a new hobby which may later develop into a profession with time and careful work; or he or she may begin to care more for the body and take more interest in sensual pleasure and fulfillment. The message here, as with all the Pages, is that care, gentleness and time are needed to bring the potential to fruition.',

'Knight of Pentacles\n\nWhen the Knight of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to develop that dimension of the personality which is comfortably and f	irmly anchored in the ordinary tasks of living. The Knight of Pentacles may enter one\s life as an industrious, humble, gentle, hard-working young man, perhaps lacking in imagination but rich in the qualities of reliability and gentleness. But if such a person enters one\'s sphere, it may be seen as an opportunity to learn more about this side of oneself through the catalyst of another.',

'Queen of Pentacles\n\nHere, in the card of the Queen of Pentacles, we meet the receptive, stable, sensuous dimension of the element of earth. This is embodied in the mythic figure of Queen Omphale, whose name means \'navel\'. Omphale appears in the cycle of stories concerning the hero Heracles, who at a low point in his career was taken to Asia and offered for sale as a nameless slave - a far cry from the hero as we first met him in the Major Arcana card of Strength. He was bought by Omphale, queen of Lydia, a woman with a good eye for a bargain; and he served her faithfully for three years, ridding Asia Minor of the bandits who infested the countryside. \n\nOmphale had been bequeathed her kingdom by her late husband, and ruled it ably because of her pragmatic and powerful character. She bought Heracles as a lover rather than a fighter, and he fathered three sons on her. She made the best of her time with the hero by indulging herself thoroughly. Reports reached Greece that Heracles had discarded his lion pelt and instead wore jeweled Hécklaces, golden bracelets, a woman\'s turban, purple shawl and a Maeonian girdle. There he sat - the story went — teasing wool from a wool-basket or spinning the thread, trembling when his mistress scolded him. He let himself be combed and manicured by Omphale\'s maids, while she dressed up in his lionpelt and wielded his club and bow.\n\nOne day the pair visited some vineyards, and the god Pan, whom we have met already in the Major Arcana card of the Devil, caught sight of them from a high hill. Falling in love with Omphale, the goat-footed god bade farewell to his nymphs and declared undying love for the Lydian queen. Omphale, well aware that Pan pursued her, suggested to Heracles as they retired for the night in a grotto that they exchange clothes. At midnight Pan crept into the grotto, found someone whom he thought was Omphale lying asleep, and with trembling hands tried to assault what turned out to be a furious Heracles. The hero kicked Pan across the grotto, and he and Omphale laughed until they cried to seethe goat-god sprawled in a corner nursing his bruises. Since that day Panhas abhorred clothes, and summons his officials naked to his rites.\n\nOmphale, the Queen of Pentacles, is an image of feminine strength and sensuality, which can enslave even an untamed brute like Heracles. In one sense she represents the sensuality of the body itself— hence her name, for the Greeks believed that passion was centred in the navel —and which is present in both men and women. This is not simply craving for physical satisfaction, but a primordial force which possesses both dignity and power. In serving Queen Omphale, Heracles passes through a kind of initiation — and we too, when we encounter the Queen of Pentacles within ourselves, must bow to the power of the instincts and acknowledge that even the highest mind and most rarefied spirituality exist in a body which is made of earth. Omphale is not, however, merely a sensualist. She is a ruler in her own right, prepared to be generous but always pragmatic and protective of her own wealth and territory. Her purchase of the hero as a lover is made not because no other lovers are available, but because she wants the best. Thus she may also be taken as an image of self-value, because Omphale treats herself and her body as well as her country with care and lavish generosity. She possesses the endurance and stability of the earth itself, and although sensuality alone cannot fill a life, Omphale is an image of great importance and value.\n\nWhen the Queen of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to learn about the full expression of his or her sensuality, the value of the body, and the importance of those pleasures which preserve and enrich life. The individual may also be called upon to learn to sustain and preserve material resources, holding conditions stable and secure and husbanding money and energy. The Queen of Pentacles may enter one\'s life as a strong, sensual woman, self-sufficient and hard-working yet generous and willing to indulge herself and others if it suits her purposes. But if such a woman enters one\'s life, it suggests that these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.',

'King of Pentacles\n\nWhen the King of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to take up the challenge of worldly things. But inner movements often need a catalyst, and therefore the King of Pentacles may enter one\'s life as an earthy, strong, successful individual-one who has the \'Midas touch\', who has the gift of manifesting creative ideas in the world. But such an individual is a catalyst for one\'s own developing material self-confidence.'

position1 = [ 

'\t\t\t\t\tThe Significator\n\nSometimes called the Covering Card, reflects the situation in which the individual finds oneself at the moment.' 

]

position2 = [ 

'\t\t\t\t\tThe Crossing Card\n\nThis card describes the situation of card one, which is generating conflict and obstruction in the immediate present. It is the thing that \'crosses\' the seeker... You. The card indicates the apparent nature of the problem. However, the crossing card is not necessarily negative in meaning, but simply represents the situation which is generating conflict and stirring up matters. In a sense, it prevents the significator from full manifestation, causing blockages in life.'

]

position3 = [ 

'\t\t\t\t\tThe Crowning Card\n\nIt is apparent simply by its visual appearance - hanging directly over the Significator - that the card which appears in this position describes the atmosphere and situation which hangs over the seeker in the immediate present. What is at the crown of something is what appears in full view on top; and thus the card which appears here reflects what is out on the surface and immediately apparent in the seeker\'s life.'

]

position4 = [ 

'\t\t\t\t\tThe Base of the Matter\n\nThis card describes the drive, instinct or aspiration which is really behind the apparent surface situation reflected by the Crowning Card. What is at the base is really what is at the root of the psyche, and often this card comes as a surprise to the seeker, who may not have been aware of an unconscious motivation which needs to be brought into awareness. We do not always act or feel things for the reasons we think, and the card which appears at the Base of the Matter will often contradict the apparent reason for our dilemma at the time of consulting the cards.'

]

position5 = [

'\t\t\t\t\tPast Influences\n\nSituation now passing out of the seeker\'s life. In the past it had been important, perhaps representing a set of values which the individual held in high esteem; but now it has lost its potency, and the seeker needs to be able to let go of whatever this card represents before the new future developments can be integrated creatively into life.'

]

position6 = [

'\t\t\t\t\tForthcoming Influences\n\nDescribes situation which is about to manifest in the seeker\'s life. This is not a long-term prognosis of a future outcome, but rather a description of the currents at work in the immediate future.'

]

position7 = [ 

'\t\t\t\t\tWhere One Finds Oneself\n\nA kind of future extension of Position One, the Significator...this card describes the attitude or inner state of affairs in which the seeker will soon find themselves.'

]

position8 = [

'\t\t\t\t\tViews of Others\n\nDescribes the image which those around us - friends and family - hold of our situation and ourselves. Implies what kind of response to our situation we can expect from others, and also what we ourselves have been unconsciously doing to project such an image to the world outside. Often an individual who is going through problems of one kind or another does not receive the understanding and sympathy from friends and loved ones that he or she hopes for, and the card often tells why not; for this is the view the world has of us, and it may contradict the way we feel as easily as it may honestly reflect our situation.'

]

position9 = [

'\t\t\t\t\tHopes and Fears\n\nBoth your \'hopes\', or \'positive outlook\' and your fears of negative outcomes can be described or objectively shown by this one card - all the cards in this Tarot reading have a double face.'

]

position10 = [

'\t\t\t\t\tThe Final Outcome\n\nThe word \'final\' can be misleading here, for nothing is absolutely final, as we have seen in the circular journey of \'The Fool\'; the card which appears in this position describes a situation not of lifelong permanence, but one which is the natural outgrowth of whatever we are going though at the moment.'

#		The Major Arcana

'THE FOOL' : 'Dionysos, the Fool, augurs the advent of a new chapter of life when he appears in a spread. A risk of some kind is required, a willingness to jump out into the unknown. The Fool is ambiguous just as Dionysus is, for we cannot know whether we will enter the Fool\'s perception of the divine or end up merely looking foolish. In this way, amidst ambiguity and excitement and fear, begins the great journey of life portrayed by the Major Arcana of the Tarot.', 

'THE MAGICIAN' : 'Hermes, the Magician, points to potential skills and creative abilities which have not yet manifested. He may appear as an upsurge of energy and an intuition of exciting new opportunities. He presages insight and an awareness of unexplored possibilities. The Fool is blind, with only his animal sense of a meaning to be found somewhere, somehow. But through his meeting with Hermes, the Magician, it becomes clear that the journey is possible, and that one has capacities that have yet to be developed.',

'THE EMPRESS' : 'The appearance of the Empress in a spread suggests the onset of a more earthy phase of life. A marriage or the birth of a child might occur; or the birth of a creative child, an artistic offspring, for this too requires the patience and nurturing of the Great Mother. Through this card we enter the realm of the body and the instincts, as a place of both peace and stagnation, life-giving and lie-suffocating. Thus the Fool, the child of heaven, discovers that he lives in a physical body and is a creature not only of spirit but also of earth.',

'THE EMPEROR' : 'Zeus, the Emperor, augurs a confrontation with the issue of the father principle in both its positive and negative forms. We are challenged to make something manifest, to concretize a creative idea, to build something in the world, to found a business perhaps, or to establish the structure of a home and family. We are asked to take a standpoint, to become effective and powerful, to formulate our ideas and ethics. We are also asked to consider where the creative young king has become the rigid, oppressive tyrant, and where our ideologies are interfering with life and growth. When the Fool meets the Emperor after his sojourn in the instinctual world, he learns to confront worldly life with his own resources, alone, according to ethics which he must develop for himself. Then he can progress on his journey with the certainty that he can be effective in life because there is something higher in which he believes, and whose authority he himself now embodies.',

'THE HIGH PRIESTESS' : 'The appearance of the High Priestess in a spread augurs the heightening of the powers of intuition, and implies that there will be an encounter of some kind with the hidden inner world which Persephone rules. The individual may be drawn inexplicably to this world through an interest in the occult or the esoteric, or through the effects of a powerful dream or the uncanny sense that \'something\' is at work in one\'s life. Thus the Fool, having learned something of his physical nature and needs and his place in the world through his earthly parents, the Empress and the Emperor, now enters the night-world, and comes, often with confusion and bewilderment, to that silent figure who embodies Mother on another, deeper and subtler level-the womb of the unconscious in which the secret of his real purpose and the pattern of his destiny are contained.',

'THE HIEROPHANT' : 'Chiron, the Hierophant, implies when he appears in a spread that the individual will begin to actively seek answers of a philosophical kind. This may emerge as the study of a particular philosophy or system of belief, or as a deep commitment to a quest for meaning in life. The Hierophant may appear in the form of an analyst, psychotherapist, priest or spiritual mentor in outside life to whom we turn for comfort and help. The Fool thus emerges from his discovery of the underworld and the hidden powers of the unconscious seeking answers to the enigma of himself and the meaning of his life. When he meets the Hierophant he encounters that part of himself which can begin to formulate, and express a personal philosophy, an individual vision of the spirit, which guides him as he leaves his childhood behind and ventures out into life\'s challenges.',

'THE LOVERS' : 'The card of the Lovers when it appears in a spread augurs the necessity of a choice of some kind, usually in love. The Fool, having learned about his own duality, must now put his values to the test. Sometimes this means a love triangle, but it can also mean the problem of too hasty a marriage, or a choice between love and a career or some creative activity. This card implies the necessity of looking carefully at the implications of one\'s choices, rather than being driven blindly, thereby inaugurating, like Paris, a great conflagration.',

'THE CHARIOT' : 'The card of the Chariot appearing in a spread augurs conflict and struggle which can result in a stronger personality. One may come face to face not only with aggression in others, but with one\'s own competitive and aggressive drives. This conflict cannot be avoided, but needs to be faced with strength and containment. Thus the Fool comes to harmony through learning to handle his own contradictions, and passes from the world of adolescence to the next stage of his journey.',

'JUSTICE' : 'The card of Justice appearing in a spread implies the need for balanced thought and impartial decision-making. But hike Athene\'s sword, this card can be double-edged. There are spheres of life where Athene\'s cool reflection is too chilly, too idealistic, and too destructive to the warmth of personal relationship. Her sword can cut the heart with general truths which are inappropriate for a particular situation. Thus Justice is, like all the Major Arcana, an ambivalent figure. The Fool must develop what Athene represents, but he cannot stay forever in her pure temple, and must pass on to the next Moral Lesson.',

'TEMPERANCE' : 'The appearance of Temperance in a spread implies the need for a flow of feeling in relationship. Iris, guardian of the rainbow, suggests the potential for harmony and cooperation resulting in a good relationship or a happy marriage. We are challenged with the issue of learning to develop a balanced heart, while also being gently reminded that the Fool cannot remain forever even with the beautiful Iris, and must pass on to the next Moral Lesson.',

'STRENGTH' : 'The card of Strength, when it appears in a spread, implies a situation where a collision with the lion within is inevitable, and where a creative handling of one\'s own rage and senseless pride is desirable. Courage, strength and self-discipline are necessary to battle with the situation. Through such an experience we can come in contact with the beast, but also with that part of us which is Heracles, the hero who can subdue it. Thus the Fool, having developed the faculties of mind and feeling, now learns to deal with his own ferocious egotism, emerging from this contest with trust in himself and integrity toward others.',

'THE HERMIT' : 'The card of Cronos, the Hermit, augurs a time of aloneness or withdrawal from the extroverted activities of life, so that the wisdom of patience may be acquired. There is an opportunity to build solid foundations if one is willing to wait. Thus the Fool at last arrives at maturity, having developed a mind and a heart, a firm sense of identity and finally a deep respect for his own limitations in the great passage of the round of time.',

'THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE' : 'The Wheel of Fortune augurs a sudden change of fortune. This may be \'good\'or \'bad\', but whichever way the Wheel turns it brings growth and a new phase of life. We cannot predict what will come to meet us-or rather, what we will turn to meet. But behind these changes stand the Moirai, an image of the center within. Thus the Fool is thrown from his complacency, and begins the descent to his own source.',

'THE HANGED MAN' : 'Prometheus, the Hanged Man, augurs the need for a voluntary sacrifice for the purpose of acquiring something of greater value. This might be the sacrifice of an external thing which has previously provided security, in the hope that some potential can be given room to develop. Or it can be the sacrifice of a cherished attitude, such as intellectual superiority, or unforgiving hatred, or a stubborn pursuit of some unobtainable fantasy. Thus the Fool responds to the challenge of the turning of the Wheel with a willingness to put his trust in the unseen workings of the unconscious, and waits-often with fear and anxiety-in the hope of a new and better life.',

'DEATH' : 'The card of Death implies that something must come to an end. Whether or not this experience is painful depends upon the person\'s capacity to accept and recognize the necessity of endings. The card of Death can augur an opportunity for a new life, if one can let go of the old one. Thus the Fool enters the underworld, leaving behind him his previous life, to prepare for an unknown future.',

'THE DEVIL' : '\n\nHere we meet the great god Pan,whom the Greeks worshipped as the Great All. In myth, Hermes fathered Pan on the nymph Dryope. The child was so ugly at birth —with horns, beard, tail and goat-legs — that his mother ran away from him in fright, and Hermes carried him up to Olympus for the gods\' amusement. Pan haunted the woods and pastures of Arcadia, and personified the fertile, phallic spirit of wild, untamed nature. But he could also occasionally be friendly to men, guarding flocks, herds, and beehives. He took part in the revels of the mountain-nymphs and helped hunters to find their quarry. On one occasion he pursued the chaste nymph Syrinx to the River Ladon, where she transformed herself into a water-reed to escape his unwelcome hairy embraces. There, since he could not distinguish her from all the rest, he cut several reeds at random, and made them into a syrinx or Pan-pipe.\n\nFrom Pan\'s name we derive the word \'panic\', because he amused himself by giving the lonely traveler sudden frights. He was despised by the other gods, but they exploited his powers. Apollo the sun-god wheedled the art of prophecy from him, and Hermes copied a pipe which he had let fall, claimed it as his own invention, and sold it to Apollo. Thus the brilliant sun-god received both his music and his prophecy illicitly from the goatish, ugly and untamed god of nature.\n\nOn an inner level, Pan, the Devil, is an image of bondage to the crudest, most instinctual aspect of human nature. Because the god was worshipped in caves and grottoes, attended by fear, his image within us suggests something that we both fear and are fascinated by - the raw, goaush, uncivilized sexual impulses which we experience as evil because of their compulsive nature. Since the dawn of the Christian era,Devil, noble and romantic about the raging lion in the card of Strength, or the willful horses of the Chariot. But it is more difficult to perceive nobility in Pan. Yet in myth he was not evil, merely untamed, amoral and natural. It is the paralysis of the humans who are held enthralled interior and fascination which creates the problem. The card of the Devil implies blocks and inhibitions, usually sexual, which arise from our lack of understanding of Pan. Although he is ugly, he is the Great All — the raw life of the body itself, amoral and crude, but nonetheless a god. The energy which is expended in keeping the Devil in his cave, shameful and hidden, is energy which is lost to the personality, but which can be released with immensely powerful effect if one is willing to look Pan in the face. Thus the Fool must learn to confront with humility the basest and most shameful aspects of himself, or he will remain forever in bondage to his own fear. Then, in order to hide this shameful secret, he must pretend that he is superior and projects his own bestiality on others, leading to prejudice, bigotry and even persecution of individualsand races who seem to him \'evil\'.The card of Pan, the Devil, implies the necessity of a confrontation with all that is shadowy, shameful and base in the personality. The Fool must free himself by gaining knowledge and honest, humble acceptance of Pan, for then he can release the creative power which is held in chains by his own panic and self-disgust. Thus he comes to the heart of the labyrinth and faces his own darkness in the essential darkness of his body, in order to become what he always was-merely natural.',

'THE TOWER' : 'The card of the Tower appearing in a spread augurs the breaking down of existing forms. This card, like the cards of Death and the Devil, depends a great deal upon the attitude of the individual in terms of how difficult or painful it is to deal with. Obviously it is more creative to ask oneself where one is constricted or bound by a false persona or image, because a willing effort to break through this pretense can spare a great deal of anguish. But it seems that the Tower will fall anyway, whether we are willing or unwilling, not because some malicious external fate decrees it, but because something within the individual has reached boiling point and can no longer live within such confines.',

'THE STAR' : 'The card of the Star when it appears in a spread portends the experience of hope, meaning and faith in the midst of difficulties. Although the Star too can be ambivalent, and can warn against blind hope without the necessary action to build upon it, the card of the Star is an augury of promise, an altogether welcome experience for the Fool who has passed through the collapse of everything which he believed to be of value in his life.',

'THE MOON' : 'On an inner level, Hecate, the moon-goddess, is an image of the mysterious watery depths of the unconscious. We have already encountered this strange and elusive realm in two other cards in the Major Arcana: the High Priestess and the Wheel of Fortune. These three cards are linked in meaning and represent a progression in deepening understanding and experience of the world of the unconscious. Through Persephone, the High Priestess, the Fool becomes aware of an intuition of his own personal depths, a secret self which lay beneath ordinary mundane life. Through the Moirai who preside over the Wheel of Fortune, he experienced the power which we call Fate, through sudden changes of fortune that reveal an invisible law or purposeful pattern within. Here, in the card of the Moon, we find in the image of Hecate an experience of the great collective sea of the unconscious from which not only the individual but the whole of life has emerged. Hecate is more than a portrayal of personal depths. She embodies the feminine principle in life itself, and the three faces and three lunar phases reflect her multifaceted power over heaven, earth and underworld. In psychological terms, it is from this oceanic realm of the human imagination that the great myths and religious symbols and works of art are born over the centuries. It is a chaotic, confusing, unbounded world of which the individual with his personal journey and search for self are only a tiny part\n\n. The meeting with Hecate, the moon-goddess, is a confrontation with a trans-personal world, where individual boundaries dissolve and the sense of direction and ego are lost. It is as though we must wait submerged in the waters of this world while the new potentials arise which will eventually become our future. But the dark waters of the collective unconscious contain both negative and positive, and it is sometimes hard to distinguish its shifting movements from madness and delusion. It can be a frightening, anxiety-provoking world, for living in the realm over which Hecate presides means living without knowledge and clarity. Something has washed over us which cleanses the past and prepares the way for the future, but we must wait as the foetus waits in the womb. The only road to Hecate\'s world is the \'royal road\' of dreams, which like the crab tantalizes us with a glimpse and then slips back into the water again. The card of the Moon is a card of gestation, full of confusion, anxiety and bewilderment. We have nothing but the dream-world and the Star of Hope to guide us, for this image of the feminine is not a personal one like that of the High Priestess. It is vague and elusive and impersonal, embodying itself as shifting moods and confusion. Hecate is never really graspable, for she is a goddess of magic, and initiates the Fool into a world greater than himself, that primal water out of which all life comes.\n\nOn a divinatory level, the card of Hecate, the moon-goddess, augurs a period of confusion, fluctuation and uncertainty. We are in the grip of the unconscious and can do nothing but wait and cling to the elusive images of dreams and the vague sense of hope and faith. Thus the Fool awaits his rebirth in the waters of a greater womb, dimly aware that his journey of personal development is only a small fragment of a vast, unknowable life which spans millennia and which remains eternally fertile yet eternally unformed.',

'THE SUN' : 'On an inner level, Apollo, the sun-god, is an image of the power of consciousness to dispel the darkness. Like Hecate, who under the name of Artemis was Apollo\'s twin sister in myth, the god personifies something greater than one individual\'s capacity to gain knowledge and insight. Apollo is an image of the urge toward consciousness which exists in all life, and therefore he is the natural complement and antithesis to Hecate. Through many long centuries and through the rise and fall of many cultures and civilizations, the thrust toward knowledge and the craving for freedom from the bondage of dark, unknown nature has driven humankind toward impressive although dangerous heights. Apollo represents the spirit of intellectual striving, combined with a vision of the future which encompasses an ideal of perfection.\n\tThus the Fool\'s encounter with Apollo the sun-god brings him the hope and clarity of daylight after the long night of waiting in the womb of Hecate. Through many trials and losses the Fool has maintained his goal and his integrity; but the card of the Moon is a dark place where, although the end of the journey is near, the Fool has lost both his confidence and his power of action. But Apollo is the dispeller of fear, and his bright light casts away shadows. The shadows of the Moon are like the night-fears of childhood, where we feel small and unimportant in the face of the vastness of the unknown, threatened by gigantic shapes that loom in the darkness. Apollo is an image of that hope and faith which spring not from any one person\'s striving, but from all of us, a human inheritance of nobility and determination which can restore the Fool\'s faith in himself because it is also a faith in the meaningfulness and purpose of the human journey. The card of the Sun symbolizes that indomitable spirit that has always struggled against superstition, helplessness, ignorance and bondage to fatalism and despair.\n\t It is this spirit which battles with the serpent Python, the embodiment of the negative power of blind instinct and primitive fear. Apollo\'s music also lifts us out of ourselves, for music speaks with a trans-personal voice, crossing cultures and centuries and embodying human tragedy and triumph. Thus Apollo is a great deity, respected by all the gods, and even the Moirai were once made subject to his will — although only once. But the sun-god too is ambivalent, for too much light too soon can kill if knowledge is premature and destroys the necessary time and darkness for things to gestate. Therefore the card of the Sun follows after the card of the Moon. The burning heat of the sun can scorch, for it does not respect nature\'s laws. Thus Apollo in myth was often rejected in his advances toward women, for his light was sometimes too bright.\n\n The card of Apollo, the sun-god, augurs a time of clarity, optimism and renewed trust. It is possible to understand the pattern, to plan for the future, to move forward. The curses of the night are dispelled, and the Fool is now armed with foresight, purpose and a faith in the striving human spirit. Thus he encounters that great masculine principle in life, working through both men and women, which moves forward toward the goal.',

'JUDGMENT' : 'The card of Judgment, when it appears in a spread, augurs a time when the rewards of past efforts appear. This is a period of summing-up, of a realization of what we have been doing and where we ourselves have created the future which now awaits us. It is an ambiguous card, for it can also imply a disturbing confrontation with all our own evasions and self-betrayals. The reward is not always a pleasant one. The Fool must now answer for his journey, for the time of harvest has arrived, and the mistakes and creative efforts of the past are gathered together to form the future. Whatever occurs to the individual in terms of experiences, the card of judgment heralds the end of a chapter in life. But unlike the card of Death, it does not imply mourning. Rather, it is a clear perception of the extent to which we have been able to be true to ourselves.',

'THE WORLD' : 'The card of the World when it appears in a spread augurs a time of achievement and integration. This is a period of triumph at the successful conclusion of a matter, or the reaching of a goal which has been worked hard for. But this peak is merely a glimpse of something mysterious and elusive, and the dancing Hermaphroditus becomes the fetus who eventually emerges from the cave as the Fool. Thus the great cycle of the Major Arcana ends where it begins, for we might start with Hermaphroditus as the unborn potential of the personality which ultimately leads to the birth of the Fool. And so the circle, like the World Snake, is complete.',

#			The Minor Arcana

#			The Suit of Cups
#	The Numbered Cards

'ACE OF CUPS' : 'The Ace of Cups heralds an outpouring of feeling, although this feeling has not yet differentiated and emerges as raw, vital and often overwhelming. The potential is implied for the beginning of a relationship, although often this has not yet manifested. The individual is ready to embark on the journey of love.',

'TWO OF CUPS' : 'The Two of Cups augurs the beginning of a relationship. It can also suggest a reconciliation where an already existing relationship has undergone difficulty or separation. It can even imply the meeting and contractual arrangements of business partners, for here too the element of relationship is invoked.',

'THREE OF CUPS' : 'The Three of Cups suggests the celebration of a marriage, the start of a love affair, the birth of a child, or some other situation of emotional fulfillment and promise. But each of these situations is also a beginning, an initiation into deeper levels of the heart\'s experience, and the herald of further explorations in the future.',

'FOUR OF CUPS' : 'The Four of Cups augurs a time of dissatisfaction, boredom and depression within a relationship. There is a feeling of being let down or cheated, although the one who does the cheating is usually oneself because of one\'s unreal expectations. This dissatisfaction can lead to long-standing, unexpressed resentment; or it can lead to looking more deeply at the relationship, a harder path because previous assumptions and fantasies will then be challenged.',

'FIVE OF CUPS' : 'The Five of Cups implies regret over past actions. Something has gone wrong, a betrayal has occurred, and there is sadness and remorse. Separation in a relationship can occur. But this card does not augur a final ending. Something remains which can be worked on, and it is up to the individual to take up the challenge and make the commitment to the future.',

'SIX OF CUPS' : 'The Six of Cups augurs a time of serenity which grows out of the testing of the dreams of the past. Sometimes an old love from the past returns, or a cherished dream which one has held in the past seems possible of fruition in the near future. The blind \'in love\' state has solidified, and although the past may seem beautiful and irrevocably lost, something of its promise emerges, tempered and strengthened, into the present. This card implies nostalgia about the past, but with a difference: The past can lead to the future, and the dream is experienced as still possible, even near achievement.',

'SEVEN OF CUPS' : 'The Seven of Cups augurs an emotional situation where many potentials are evident, but where the individual is faced with the challenge of choosing and acting in realistic terms to make those potentials manifest.',

'EIGHT OF CUPS' : 'The Eight of Cups represents the most diffcult stage of Psyche\'s journey toward her goal of relationship: the voluntary giving up of hope for the future. No living mortal can descend into Hades\' realm, and as far as Psyche is concerned, this final task that Aphrodite has set must mean death. Nevertheless she obeys the goddess, for she is loyal to her commitment to love. Thus it is a letting go of hope. All the tasks so meticulously performed, suggested by the eight neatly stacked cups, have been to no avail. She sees the situation as it truly is — that Aphrodite will never relent — and so in despair she turns her back and walks away from her past hopes.\n\tThis stage of relationship is one of the most painful, because it means that there is nothing further that can be done. Increased efforts avail nothing; we must give up and start again. Many people, when confronted with the dilemma reflected by the Eight of Cups, refuse to acknowledge the impasse, and continue to plead, bully, bludgeon or blackmail the partner in the hope of a response which is no longer possible in the present circumstances. The underworld, as we saw in the Major Arcana card of Death, is a symbol of mourning and the relinquishing of control; it is the place of the death and transformation of our old attitudes. Therefore, when nothing furthers, we must be willing to let go, not as a kind of \'deal\' to guarantee a future reconciliation — for that is not true relinquishing — but because we can do nothing else. This is a bowing to what seems like fate, an acceptance of an ending. Whatever happens, this letting go will change us, because it is a submission to that which is greater — not the willfulness of the partner, but the will of the divine, imaged here as the great goddess of love.\n\nThe Eight of Cups implies the necessity of giving something up. The truth of the situation must be faced; no further action will avail, and there is no way to go except to let go. Often this is accompanied by depression, for the underworld is a place of mourning. The future cannot be manipulated; we go empty-handed into the unknown.',

'NINE OF CUPS' : 'The Nine of Cups heralds a time of pleasure and satisfaction, and the fulfillment of a cherished wish. It represents the reward for efforts made, and the validation of one\'s commitment.',

'TEN OF CUPS' : 'The Ten of Cups represents a stateof permanence and ongoing contentment. The ecstasy of the reunion of the lovers in the Nine of Cups has not dissipated, as did the celebration of the Three into the discontent of the Four, for this marriage is built upon a conscious union of two loving but separate partners. Thus they can enjoy a future which will withstand any challenges offered by life or by the gods.\n\nThat Psyche is raised to immortal status implies that her love for Eros now encompasses not only a personal, sensual dimension, but a spiritual one as well. Eros has been humanized by Psyche\'s love; he no longer needs to hide his face from her sight. Psyche, on the other hand, experiences that sense of connectedness with the divine which deep love can sometimes bring. It is sometimes said that loving another person opens the heart to loving life itself; life has meaning and purpose, and a larger, brighter world appears before one\'s vision. Plato once wrote that when we look into the face of the beloved, we see there the reflection of the god to whose choir we once belonged. It is as though love, when it has passed through many tests and been built upon honesty and humility, connects us with our own souls, and with a feeling of permanence, meaning and rightness in life. This is the promise inherent in the Ace of Cups, which culminates in the Ten. Not every relationship can achieve it, and no relationship can achieve it all the time. Yet we humans seem to go on trying.\n\nThe Ten of Cups augurs ongoing contentment and permanence in the realm of the heart.',

'PAGE OF CUPS' : 'When the Page of Cups appears in a spread, the birth of something new on the feeling level is suggested. This might be a new relationship, a new quality of feeling within a relationship, even the birth of a child. Often the Pape of Cups augurs a renewal of the capacity to love, beginning with love of self, after a time of hurt and withdrawal. This delicate quality must be nurtured or it can rapidly vanish.',

'KNIGHT OF CUPS' : 'When the Knight of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to experience this heady and romantic dimension of love. Often the Knight augurs a proposal of marriage, or an experience of falling in love. Sometimes, on another level, he implies an artistic proposition, a relationship of another kind which is no less exalted and idealistic. Or he may enter one\'s life as a poetic and sensitive young man-a herald of one\'s own emerging romanticism.',

'QUEEN OF CUPS' : 'When the Queen of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to encounter the deep, unknowable, paradoxical world of feeling in himself or herself. The Queen of Cups may enter one\'s life as a mysterious, hypnotic woman, not necessarily overtly seductive yet strangely disturbing, and a catalyst for the emergence of deep feelings and fantasies which have previously been hidden from awareness. She may appear as a beloved or as a rival, but either way such an encounter is not mere chance. It is rather an augury for the emergence of these soul qualities within the individual. For the woman who is unaware of the Helen in herself and identifies with the maternal or practical sides of femininity, the Queen of Cups implies that it is time to meet her, even if the catalyst is the \'other woman\'. For the man who is unaware of the depths of his own soul, and bases his reality on rational thought and concrete facts, the Queen of Cups heralds a deepening and development of the inner life, whether or not the catalyst is an actual woman.',

'KING OF CUPS' : 'When the King of Cups appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to experience this ambivalent side of himself or herself-the gifted counsellor and healer who can empathize with and help others, yet who cannot quite trust life enough to take its course. It is characteristic that many of those in the helping professions choose such a vocation because they have been wounded through personal relationships, often those with the parents; and thus they form relationships where they remain ultimately in control and cannot be that deeply hurt again. Although this kind of dynamic may contribute a great deal to others, one cheats oneself. If the King of Cups enters the individual\'s life in the form of a person who embodies these qualities, then this may be taken as an indication that it is time to meet this dimension of oneself.',

#			The Suit of Wands
#	The numbered cards

'ACE OF WANDS' : 'The Ace of Wands heralds an up rush of creative energy, although this energy has not yet formulated as a goal or project. Restlessness and dissatisfaction with present circumstances are accompanied by a strong feeling that new things are possible. The individual is about to embark on an adventure in pursuit of a vision.',

'TWO OF WANDS' : 'The Two of Wands, like the other Twos of the Minor Arcana, polarizes the raw energy of the Ace, and here that polarization implies the adventurer and his newly conceived goal. The restlessness and unformed power of the Ace has begun to coalesce as a particular vision, although just how that vision might be achieved is not at all clear. Jason does not yet know about the Golden Fleece; but he knows now, because Chiron has told him, that he is a prince and the rightful heir to the throne of Iolkos, and that his father Aeson has been deposed and imprisoned by his wicked uncle Pelias. The feeling of potential has here crystallized into something definite, although the real creative adventure of Jason\'s future — the pursuit of the Golden Fleece — will only emerge once Jason steps forth on the first stage of his journey. \n\nThus begin all creative ventures: a little at a time. One idea leads to another, and often the first one is not the final one, but merely a prelude. However, the prelude is sufficient to get us moving out of the sanctuary of the cave, because of the feeling that we could have more than we have, or be more than we are. Jason\'s journey to Iolkos, the place of his rightful inheritance, is fraught with danger, for he has an enemy there who would cheerfully take his life. He cannot predict the outcome, and if he will succeed or fail. But he believes in his vision enough to try, and firmly grips the wands which symbolize the fire of the imagination. Otherwise he — or we would remain peaceful but forever stifled in the cave, safe but never fulfilling those potentials which are a birthright but which require vision to bring into concrete being.\n\nThe Two of Wands heralds the formulation of a new aim, idea, goal or creative project. This new idea may not be the final shape of the future, but it is full of potential, and sufficient to lure the individual out of his or her present confines into a new creative venture. Everything here depends upon the courage of the individual to take the new idea up with both hands, and to put faith in that invisible creative power which has generated the vision of the new path.',

'THREE OF WANDS' : 'The Three of Wands implies a stage of initial completion of a creative idea or project. Good foundations have been laid, enthusiasm is high, and there is a feeling of satisfaction and optimism about the future potential of the project...But there is also hard work ahead, and new plans which must be put into action before the full promise can be realized.',

'FOUR OF WANDS' : 'The Four of Wands is a card of harvest and reward. The challenge of a new creative idea has been met, hard work has been applied, and now the individual can reap the solid reward which has been earned through effort. Like the Three ofWands, this card implies something worth celebrating; but unlike the Three, it has a more solid base, and benefits are already evident. The challenge of capturing the Golden Fleece is a daunting one; how can one man alone sail to the ends of the earth, and in what? Jason has responded to this challenge by gathering around him those friends who can help him to achieve his aims. All these heroes in the myth have different skills, according to their natures. Heracles has strength; Theseus, a fiery adventurer like Jason, has creative vision; the Twins have the cutting edge of the clever mind, and Orpheus has the deep feeling and empathy to disarm any foe. Whether we take these friends as real people whoses support we can enlist, or as inner resources upon which we can draw, at this stage of the process of creative work the help is available by which the goal can be reached. With such a heroic crew gathered, and such a splendid ship built, for Jason satisfaction is in order.\n\nThe Four of Wands augurs a time of reward for efforts made. A creative idea has yielded early fruit, and the individual has every right to celebrate the concrete results of his or her efforts. But, this is only a stage on the journey, and soon the ship must set sail and face the hardest challenges before the final goal is reached.',

'FIVE OF WANDS' : 'The Five of Wands augurs a time of struggle where the individual must battle with the dragon of material reality to achieve the goal. Mundane matters may begin to go wrong, and more attention must be paid to the demands and limits of concrete reality; or the individual falls into the grip of a depressive or apathetic mood. Compromises must be made while still retaining the integrity of the original vision.',

'SIX OF WANDS' : 'The Six of Wands augurs public acclaim or acknowledgement of some kind. This might take the form of a promotion, a qualification, or the recognition of some piece of creative work.',

'SEVEN OF WANDS' : 'The Seven of Wands augurs a struggle with other people\'s creative ideas-stiff competition. The individual is challenged to improve upon and develop his or her project in the face of an envious and competitive world and needs to learn to value his or her ambition and competitive instinct.',

'EIGHT OF WANDS' : 'The Eight of Wands heralds a period of action after delay or struggle. Travel is sometimes implied, or a clear stretch of fruitful creative activity, where the imagination flows unchecked after anxieties and tensions have been overcome or resolved.',

'NINE OF WANDS' : 'The Nine of Wands heralds a time when, at the point of exhaustion, a final challenge arises to prevent us reaching our goal; and where, somehow, mysteriously, we can find the strength in reserve to meet the challenge. This strength is only available when we have used up every other possibility, and it seems to be invoked by both our need and our willingness, despite exhaustion, to try one more time.',

'TEN OF WANDS' : 'The Ten of Wands implies that the individual is overburdened and oppressed by having taken on more than he or she can deal with. The imagination has been stifled by too many worldly concerns, and some of the youthful daring and willingness to take risks have been lost. Certain things may need to be relinquished so that the creative process can be refreshed and a new cycle may begin.',

#	The Court Cards

'PAGE OF WANDS' : 'When the Page of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to discover some new stirring of creative potential within himself or herself. This may often manifest as restlessness at work, a vague feeling of dissatisfaction not yet strong enough to motivate a change, and a hint or glimpse that one might be able to expand one\'s life in some way. The initial fantasies which accompany such restlessness do not have the up rushing power of the Ace of Wands, and may ultimately turn out to be impractical or impossible. Yet it is important to take them seriously, for they are the harbingers of a stronger source of inspiration, and need to be nurtured rather than stamped upon as though such restlessness were merely a \'bad phase\'rather than a herald.',

'KNIGHT OF WANDS' : 'When the Knight of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to develop the volatile, exuberant and adventurous qualities embodied in the figure of Bellerophon. Often on a divinatory level the Knight of Wands manifests as a change of residence, because the individual suddenly feels too cramped by his or her environment and seeks broader and greener pastures. Sometimes the Knight of Wands will enter one\'s life in the form of a charming, exciting and rather unreliable young man, full of new ideas, who inspires but who must be taken with the proverbial grain of salt lest he lead one into a bad fall. But if such an individual enters one\'s sphere, it should be seen as an augury that these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.',

'QUEEN OF WANDS' : 'When the Queen of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to begin to develop these qualities of warmth, constancy, loyalty and creative sustaining of a vision which Penelope so aptly symbolizes. The Queen of Wands may enter one\'s life as such an imaginative and magnetic woman, full of warmth and life. But if such a person enters one\'s sphere it is not by chance, but rather an augury that the individual is about to meet these attributes within.',

'KING OF WANDS' : 'When the King of Wands appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to encounter that dimension of the personality which initiates new ideas and sells them to others, thereby generating change in one\'s own life and in the immediate environment. It is the spirit of leadership, the belief that one has a better idea which is worth promulgating and working to make manifest. This dimension of life may appear in the form of a fiery, impulsive individual entering one\'s sphere, someone who infects others with the power of his ideas. But if such a person enters one\'s life it is not by chance, but is rather an augury of one\'s own need for development.',

#			The Suit of Swords
#	The Numbered Cards

'ACE OF SWORDS' : 'The Ace of Swords implies that out of conflict some new creative viewpoint will emerge. The mental powers are awakening and this means change in one\'s life; the old order is threatened, and conflicts are bound to arise. Ultimately a resolution will be possible but there is an inevitability of collision and struggle before such a peace is in sight.',

'TWO OF SWORDS' : 'The Two of Swords implies a state of tense balance where there is a refusal to face some impending situation of conflict. A more creative way of handling this situation might be to try to face what is before one, rather than attempting to preserve the status quo, which will eventually be disrupted anyway.',

'THREE OF SWORDS' : 'The Three of Swords is a sorrowful card, because the strife or conflict impended in the Two has at last erupted and come out into the open. Thus the theme of initial completion which links all the Threes in the Minor Arcana and is here reflected in a painful situation, where some separation or heartbreak has revealed itself. Yet while it is painful, this card, which is undoubtedly a diffcult one, represents a release of energy, for at least there is movement from the stagnant and unpleasant tension of the Two. Whatever has happened is in some way necessary, because something is at work which requires such conflict before it can unfold to its eventual creative end. Here Clytemnestra has had her revenge, and this revenge was inevitable from the moment that Agamemnon chose his own glory over the life of his daughter. Something set in motion in the past comes to fruition in the Three of Swords, and the fruit is rarely pleasant. This is the deepest meaning of the curse in Greek myth: not a spell or bad fate cast by some capricious god, but the inevitable working out of the consequences of human choice over time, which sooner or later will result in heartbreak or conflict when the bill comes due.\n\nThe sorrowful vision of the Three of Swords thus brings with it a feeling of relief, for the poison has come out, and therefore a chance of future healing becomes possible. Resentments which have remained subterranean because we are frightened of conflict and anger have a way of bursting through at last, but often through the next generation, who are forced to act out the problems which the preceding ones refused to face. Unpleasant though the Three of Swords is, it is nevertheless a creative step from the Two, and an ultimate resolution is now possible.\n\nThe Three of Swords heralds strife, conflict or separation. This painful state is in some way necessary, and there is a realization that blindness and self-delusion cannot go on. This is like the breaking of an abscess, so that the body can begin to heal.',

'FOUR OF SWORDS' : 'The Four of Swords heralds a time of quiet recuperation and introversion, where the individual can build up strength in preparation for further efforts. If this card appears in a spread, it is perhaps wise to accept solitude or withdrawal, and not seek to fill the time with activities; for some stillness is needed to marshal one\'s thoughts and order one\'s life.',

'FIVE OF SWORDS' : 'The Five of Swords augurs the necessity of facing one\'s own limits, and recognizing that life needs to be lived within the confines of one\'s capabilities. Often there is a situation where the individual has taken on too much, and must swallow pride and back off, facing honestly what is possible before moving forward.',

'SIX OF SWORDS' : 'The Six of Swords suggests a time when the mind\'s capacity for understanding helps to ease a difficult and anxiety-provoking time into a more peaceful passage. Insight smooths the storm-clouds, and one can retain one\'s dignity and self-respect.',

'SEVEN OF SWORDS' : 'The Seven of Swords heralds a time when it is necessary to use guile, tact, diplomacy, and wit rather than strong armed bullying tactics to achieve one\'s ends. This may leave an uncomfortable feeling of falseness, but life may require it.',

'EIGHT OF SWORDS' : 'The Eight of Swords heralds a situation where the individual is unable to act because of his or her fear of the consequences. A decision is necessary, but either choice will lead to trouble. There is a dawning realization that one has created the dilemma oneself, for there is usually a long past of avoidance, duplicity, blindness and fear of confrontation, often to \'avoid hurting\' someone, which lies behind the present impasse. It is important to face honestly one\'s own part in the problem.',

'NINE OF SWORDS' : 'The Nine of Swords heralds a period of great anxiety and foreboding about the future. It is important to examine where guilt about the past might be behind such fears, rather than being enslaved by them to one\'s future detriment.',

'TEN OF SWORDS' : 'The Ten of Swords heralds the final ending of a difficult situation. The ending may be painful, but at last the situation is faced truthfully, and a new future, with fewer conflicts, can begin.',

#	The Court Cards

'PAGE OF SWORDS' : 'When the Page of Swords appears in a spread, it is time to meet within oneself the childlike curiosity and potential for spiteful gossip which the Page embodies, and which marks the beginning of the use of mental powers. One may oneself be the victim of others\' gossip; or there can be a tendency to start petty quarrels and to be irritable and difficult. But these things reflect the emergence of new ideas and true independent thinking-often in one who has been accustomed to accepting the views of others.',

'KNIGHT OF SWORDS' : 'Here, in the card of the Knight of Swords, we meet the flexible, volatile and changeable dimension of the element of air, which is constantly in motion. This turbulence in the realm of the mind is embodied in the mythic quarrelsome Dioscuri, the Warrior Twins, who were called Castor and Polydeuces. Their mother was Leda, queen of Sparta, who was pursued by the amorous Zeus, king of the gods. When she refused the god\'s advances, he transformed himself into a swan and raped her. She was already pregnant by her husband King Tyndareos, and bore two eggs by her swan-lover. Out of one were hatched two mortal children, Castor and his sister Clytemnestra, whom we have already met in the story of Orestes in the numbered cards of the Suit of Swords. Out of the other egg came the two divine children of Zeus, Polydeuces and Helen whom we met in the Minor Arcana card of the Queen of Cups. Thus the Dioscuri were twin brothers, but Castor was mortal and Polydeuces divine.\n\nThe Dioscuri, who were never separated from one another in any adventure, became the pride of Sparta. Castor was famous as a soldier and tamer of horses, Polydeuces as a boxer. Both were pugnacious and known for their propensity to start quarrels. They eventually quarrelled with another pair of twins, called Idas and Lynceus. Idas killed Castor, the mortal twin, and Polydeuces in turn killed Lynceus with his spear. Zeus, intervening on behalf of his son, struck Idas dead with a thunderbolt. Polydeuces was grief-stricken at the loss of his brother, and prayed to his father Zeus that he might not outlive him. He refused immortality unless Castor might share it with him. Zeus therefore allowed them both to spend their days alternately in the divine abode of Olympus and beneath the earth in Hades\' realm; and he set their images among the stars as the Twins.\n\nThe Dioscuri are images of an abrupt and mercurial energy, the capacity of the human mind to be suddenly inspired or taken over by anew idea which throws the old order into chaos and leaves changes in its wake. The duality of the heavenly Twins suggests a duality or duplicity in this realm of the mind, because often these sudden new ideas which break in upon our humdrum lives either in augurate conflict or are themselves ambivalent and full of conflict. The pugnacity and callousness of the Dioscuri also tell us something about the quality of mental energy described by the Knight of Swords: It takes no account of human feeling, and is often the cause of relationships being disrupted or severed because the individual is suddenly possessed by an idea which demands his or her hurting another. Thus there is a basic attitude inherent in the Knight of Swords, which is not unlike the figure of Don Juan in romantic legend. This figure is intensely attractive because of his brilliance, but he is callous; he has no real feeling for the continuity of the past and the integrity of human relationship, and is not prepared to make personal sacrifices or compromise the cool and lofty vision of the moment.\n\nIn ordinary life we may see the energy of the Dioscuri at work when an individual abandons responsibilities and ties in order to pursue some new and youthful adventure. In psychology, this impulse is called the puer aeternus, the eternal youth, and it is an impulse which is more dominant in some people than in others. The spirit of the Knight of Swords cannot bear to grow old, or stagnate in too much bondage. Prolonged intimacy makes him fidget, and he needs constant mental stimuli in order to avoid becoming bored. He possesses the peculiar double face of being both destructive to feeling ties and of creatively catapulång an individual out of boredom and bondage into new phases of growth, which often necessitates a broken heart or two. Thus he serves both a negative and a positive function at the same time reflected here in the image of the Twins. To the Dioscuri, conflict and movement are natural, and one cannot spend too long feeling guilty about who might be hurt when the mind abruptly turns and moves in anew direction. The quicksilver quality of the Twins is reflected in the image by the agitation of the horse, which hardly touches the ground and which cannot remain still, bearing its twin riders onward toward new adventures.\n\nWhen the Knight of Swords appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to be prepared for sudden changes which break apart the ordinary patterns of life. These changes may be inaugurated by an individual coming into one\'s life who possesses the quicksilver, fascinating and disruptive qualities of the Dioscuri; or it may take the form of a new idea or vision which erupts from within oneself and which throws ordinary life into disorder for a time. Thus, whether the Knight of Swords appears from without or within, his gift is the ability to move with changes, and the turbulence which he brings may ultimately lead to a broader vision of life.',

'QUEEN OF SWORDS' : 'When the Queen of Swords appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to meet that dimension of himself or herself which clings unswaying to an immovable faith in high ideals. These ideals may be noble and lofty, and help to improve consciousness and the quality of life. But they may also reject life, and be a defense against the fear of being human and therefore vulnerable to hurt. The individual needs to see where he or she might create problems through demanding superhuman perfection of others or oneself. If the Queen of Swords enters one\'s life as a strong, idealistic, aloof woman, it may be seen as a catalyst through which one discovers this aspect of oneself.',

'KING OF SWORDS' : 'When the King of Swords appears in a spread, it is time to meet within oneself the ambivalent gift of intellectual leadership and strategy. Intellectual prowess and inspired ideas about how to develop things in the future are qualities which he possesses in abundance. Sometimes this figure can appear in one\'s life in the form of an individual who is striking by virtue of his mental gifts and his capacity to innovate changes in the world. But if such an individual enters one\'s sphere it may be seen as a catalyst through whom one can contact this dimension of oneself.',

#			The Suit of Pentacles
#	The Numbered Cards

'ACE OF PENTACLES' : 'The Ace of Pentacles augurs the possibility of material achievement, because the raw energy for this kind of work is now available to the individual. Often money is made available through a legacy or some other source, coupled with the ingenuity and persistence to utilize these resources effectively.',

'TWO OF PENTACLES' : 'The Two of Pentacles heralds a time when money and energy are likely to be available for new projects that might lead to a rewarding future; but the individual must be willing to put his resources to work, taking risks and using capital, rather than hoarding and saving at a time when new opportunities arise. Thus the Two of Pentacles is likely to be a welcome card to those who know how to \'play\' with money.',

'THREE OF PENTACLES' : 'The Three of Pentacles heralds a time of early success in some material endeavor. A project may earn profits, or a creative venture such as a book may show early success in the market. But as with all the Threes, this is not a final resolution, but a stage which will hopefully lead through hard work and difficulty to a more permanent reward.',

'FOUR OF PENTACLES' : 'The Four of Pentacles warns about an attitude of holding too tightly to things which are bound up with one\'s sense of self-value. The fear of loss may mean no loss, but it also means no gain, for there is a stagnation of creative energy which can eventually not only block funds but also block self-expression.',

'FIVE OF PENTACLES' : 'The Five of Pentacles augurs a period of financial difficulty or loss. This may be accompanied by a loss of faith in oneself, and it is important to try to respond to the challenge not only by letting go if necessary and preparing to begin again, but also by considering where one\'s own nature might have led to or exacerbated the problem. A reorientation is now possible not only on a financial level but also on an inner one.',

'SIX OF PENTACLES' : 'The Six of Pentacles augurs a situation where there is money or substance to be shared, and where the individual will himself or herself be called upon to offer generosity or be the recipient of another\'s generosity. Faith in life and in one\'s capacities is regained.',

'SEVEN OF PENTACLES' : 'The Seven of Pentacles augurs a time when a difficult work decision must be made. Care and forethought are needed, and the question arises of whether to continue to develop what one has already built, or to put energy into a new project.',

'EIGHT OF PENTACLES' : 'The Eight of Pentacles augurs a period when the individual plays the role of the hard-working apprentice who is struggling to acquire a new skill. This card can suggest a talent which the individual has recently discovered and which is worthy of development and effort, or it can imply that a hobby could be developed into a profession. The individual may experience great enthusiasm and interest in some new field of work which requires him or her to become a hard-working trainee, often at a time of life when one \'ought\' to be firmly established.',

'NINE OF PENTACLES' : 'The Nine of Pentacles augurs a period where one may be justifiably pleased with oneself and with what one has been able to achieve. There is often a strong sense of solid identity, a feeling of one\'s unique abilities and the worth of one\'s life. This is not inflated, but based on a realistic appreciation of one\'s skills. This card reflects the solitary and self-sufficient enjoyment of good things, which does not depend upon anyone else\'s agreement or validation to provide pleasure and deep satisfaction.',

'TEN OF PENTACLES' : 'The Ten of Pentacles suggests a period of ongoing contentment and security, and a sense of something permanent having been established which can be handed on to others. This may be a material inheritance of wealth or property, or it may be an artistic achievement such as a book or painting which one knows will live on and offer its value independent of one\'s own span of life.',

#	The Court Cards

'PAGE OF PENTACLES' : 'Triptolemus, the Page of Pentacles, is an image of those early and delicate efforts to relate to the sensual world which must emerge first before any larger ambitions of a material kind can be pursued. In common with all the Pages of the Minor Arcana, the Page of Pentacles is a bud, a bare beginning, and like all buds this gentle, delicate beginning of recognition of the value of the material world must be nurtured and protected lest it be crushed through undervaluing and neglect. Often the Page of Pentacles can suggest the early interest in some new hobby, which starts as a mere idea or enthusiasm, but which if cared for and developed slowly and patiently may eventually become a full-blown vocation which yields both material and emotional rewards and fulfilment. We have all experienced these little enthusiasms — but how many of us really follow them up, and try the necessary first small steps which might lead to something greater? Triptolemus, the Page of Pentacles, is a serious child, responsible and hard-working as few children are; at a young age he is given care of his father\'s cattle, instead of playing like other boys. Thus the energy of the Page of Pentacles needs to be treated gently but seriously. Likewise the image of Triptolemus may reflect the delicate beginnings of sensuality emerging, particularly if the individual has all his or her life undervalued this dimension of experience.\n\n The beginnings of sensual awareness in a more intellectual or imaginative temperament may be overlooked or despised, yet the myth of Triptolemus suggests that if the life of the body is recognized and valued as the boy recognizes and values the goddess Demeter, great rewards may emerge in the future. For many people this nascent awareness of the body may take the form of a desire to care for oneself better, through a better diet or exercise, or more time for relaxation, or an interest in gardening or caring for animals - playful things which lead to a deeper and stronger relationship with the earth itself.\n\nWhen the Page of Pentacles appears in a spread, it marks the gathering together of energy which can eventually be used for building things in the world and for fulfilling the needs of the body. Sometimes money becomes available in small sums, which need to be saved and nurtured rather than thrown away as insignificant. Sometimes the individual takes up a new hobby which may later develop into a profession with time and careful work; or he or she may begin to care more for the body and take more interest in sensual pleasure and fulfillment. The message here, as with all the Pages, is that care, gentleness and time are needed to bring the potential to fruition.',

'KNIGHT OF PENTACLES' : 'When the Knight of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to develop that dimension of the personality which is comfortably and f	irmly anchored in the ordinary tasks of living. The Knight of Pentacles may enter one\s life as an industrious, humble, gentle, hard-working young man, perhaps lacking in imagination but rich in the qualities of reliability and gentleness. But if such a person enters one\'s sphere, it may be seen as an opportunity to learn more about this side of oneself through the catalyst of another.',

'QUEEN OF PENTACLES' : 'Here, in the card of the Queen of Pentacles, we meet the receptive, stable, sensuous dimension of the element of earth. This is embodied in the mythic figure of Queen Omphale, whose name means \'navel\'. Omphale appears in the cycle of stories concerning the hero Heracles, who at a low point in his career was taken to Asia and offered for sale as a nameless slave - a far cry from the hero as we first met him in the Major Arcana card of Strength. He was bought by Omphale, queen of Lydia, a woman with a good eye for a bargain; and he served her faithfully for three years, ridding Asia Minor of the bandits who infested the countryside. \n\nOmphale had been bequeathed her kingdom by her late husband, and ruled it ably because of her pragmatic and powerful character. She bought Heracles as a lover rather than a fighter, and he fathered three sons on her. She made the best of her time with the hero by indulging herself thoroughly. Reports reached Greece that Heracles had discarded his lion pelt and instead wore jeweled Hécklaces, golden bracelets, a woman\'s turban, purple shawl and a Maeonian girdle. There he sat - the story went — teasing wool from a wool-basket or spinning the thread, trembling when his mistress scolded him. He let himself be combed and manicured by Omphale\'s maids, while she dressed up in his lionpelt and wielded his club and bow.\n\nOne day the pair visited some vineyards, and the god Pan, whom we have met already in the Major Arcana card of the Devil, caught sight of them from a high hill. Falling in love with Omphale, the goat-footed god bade farewell to his nymphs and declared undying love for the Lydian queen. Omphale, well aware that Pan pursued her, suggested to Heracles as they retired for the night in a grotto that they exchange clothes. At midnight Pan crept into the grotto, found someone whom he thought was Omphale lying asleep, and with trembling hands tried to assault what turned out to be a furious Heracles. The hero kicked Pan across the grotto, and he and Omphale laughed until they cried to seethe goat-god sprawled in a corner nursing his bruises. Since that day Panhas abhorred clothes, and summons his officials naked to his rites.\n\nOmphale, the Queen of Pentacles, is an image of feminine strength and sensuality, which can enslave even an untamed brute like Heracles. In one sense she represents the sensuality of the body itself — hence her name, for the Greeks believed that passion was centred in the navel —and which is present in both men and women. This is not simply craving for physical satisfaction, but a primordial force which possesses both dignity and power. In serving Queen Omphale, Heracles passes through a kind of initiation — and we too, when we encounter the Queen of Pentacles within ourselves, must bow to the power of the instincts and acknowledge that even the highest mind and most rarefied spirituality exist in a body which is made of earth. Omphale is not, however, merely a sensualist. She is a ruler in her own right, prepared to be generous but always pragmatic and protective of her own wealth and territory. Her purchase of the hero as a lover is made not because no other lovers are available, but because she wants the best. Thus she may also be taken as an image of self-value, because Omphale treats herself and her body as well as her country with care and lavish generosity. She possesses the endurance and stability of the earth itself, and although sensuality alone cannot fill a life, Omphale is an image of great importance and value.\n\nWhen the Queen of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to learn about the full expression of his or her sensuality, the value of the body, and the importance of those pleasures which preserve and enrich life. The individual may also be called upon to learn to sustain and preserve material resources, holding conditions stable and secure and husbanding money and energy. The Queen of Pentacles may enter one\'s life as a strong, sensual woman, self-sufficient and hard-working yet generous and willing to indulge herself and others if it suits her purposes. But if such a woman enters one\'s life, it suggests that these qualities are trying to emerge from within oneself.',

'KING OF PENTACLES' : 'When the King of Pentacles appears in a spread, it is time for the individual to take up the challenge of worldly things. But inner movements often need a catalyst, and therefore the King of Pentacles may enter one\'s life as an earthy, strong, successful individual-one who has the \'Midas touch\', who has the gift of manifesting creative ideas in the world. But such an individual is a catalyst for one\'s own developing material self-confidence.'
